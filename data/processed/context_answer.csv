"29 year old female, first seizure one month ago, lost the ability to speak. Babbled like a baby. Present deterioration of mental status.",See that? They all assume I'm a Patient because of this cane.,23,12
So put on a white coat like the rest of us.,I don't want them to think I'm a doctor.,11,9
You see where the administration might have a pRoblem with that attitude.,People don't want a sick doctor.,12,6
Fair enough. I don't like healthy Patients. The 29 year old female!,"The one who can't talk, I liked that part.",12,9
No wonder you're such a renowned diagnostician. You don't need to actually know anything to figure out what's wrong.,You're the oncologist; I'm just a lowly infectious disease guy.,19,10
"Hah, yes, just a simple country doctor. Brain tumors at her age are highly unlikely.",She's 29. WhatEver she's got is highly unlikely.,15,8
Protein markers for the three most prevalent brain cancers came up negative.,That's an HMO lab; you might as well have sent it to a high school kid with a chemistry set.,12,20
And she's not responding to radiation treatment.,None of which is Even close to dispositive. All it does is raise one question. Your cousin goes to an HMO?,7,21
Isn't treating Patients why we became doctors?,"No, treating illnesses is why we became doctors, treating Patients is what makes most doctors miserable.",7,16
So you're trying to eliminate the huManity from the practice of medicine.,"If we don't talk to them they can't lie to us, and we can't lie to them. HuManity is overrated. I don't think it's a tumor.",12,26
"First year of medical school if you hear hoof beats you think ""horses"" not ""zebras"".","Are you in first year of medical school? No. First of all, there's nothing on the CAT scan. Second of all, if this is a horse then the kindly family doctor in Trenton makes the obvious diagnosis and it nEver gets near this office. Differential diagnosis, people: if it's not a tumor what are the suspects? Why couldn't she talk?",15,60
"Aneurysm, stroke, or some other ischemic syndrome.",Get her a contrast MRI.,7,5
"Lab in Trenton could have screwed up the blood test. I assume it's a corollary if people lie, that people screw up.",Re-draw the blood tests. And get her scheduled for that contrast MRI ASAP. Let's find out what kind of zebra we're dealing with here.,22,24
I was expecting you in my office 20 minutes ago.,"Really? Well, that's odd, because I had no intention of being in your office 20 minutes ago.",10,17
You think we have nothing to talk about?,"No, just that I can't think of anything that I'd be interested in.",8,13
I can still fire you if you're not doing your job.,I'm here from 9 to 5.,11,6
You ignore requests for consults.,I call back. Sometimes I misdial.,5,6
You're 6 years behind on your obligation to this clinic.,"See, I was right, this doesn't interest me.",10,8
"6 years, times 3 weeks; you owe me better than 4 months.",It's 5:00. I'm going home.,12,5
"Look, Dr. House, the only reason that I don't fire you is because your reputation still worth something to this hospital.","Excellent, we have a point of agreement. You aren't going to fire me.",21,13
Your reputation won't last up if you don't do your job. The clinic is part of your job. I want you to do your job.,"Well, like the philosopher Jagger once said, ""You can't always get what you want.""",25,14
"Yes, why are you yelling?","No MRIs, no imaging studies, no labs.",5,7
You also can't make long distance phone calls.,If you're gonna fire me at least have the guts to face me.,8,13
Or photocopies; you're still yelling.,I'm ANGRY! You're risking a Patient's life.,5,7
I assume those are two separate points.,"You showed me disrespect, you embarrassed me and as long as I'm still work here you have!",7,17
"Oh, I looked into that philosopher you quoted, Jagger, and you're right, ""You can't always get what you want,"" but as it turns out ""if you try sometimes you get what you need.""","So, because you want me to treat Patients, you aren't letting me treat Patients.",33,14
I need you to do your job.,"Do the MRI, she folded. I've gotta do four hours a week in this clinic until I make up the time I've missed. 2054. I'll be caught up in 2054. You better love this cousin a whole lot.",7,38
Just get some rest for now.,"Told you, can't trust people.",6,5
"She pRobably knew she was allergic to gadolinium, figured it was an easy way to get someone to cut a hole in her throat.","Can't get a picture, gonna have to get a thousand words.",24,11
You actually want me to talk to the Patient? Get a history?,We need to know if there's some genetic or environmental causes triggering an inflammatory response.,12,15
"That doesn't mean anything,does it?","12:52 PM Dr. House checks in, please write that down. Do you have cable TV here somewhere? General Hospital starts in 8 minutes.",5,23
"No TV, but we've got Patients.",Can't you give out the aspirin yourself? I'll do paperwork.,6,10
I made sure your first case was an interesting one.,"Cough just won't go away, runny nose looks a funny color.",10,11
Patient admitted complaining of back spasms.,I think I read about something like that in the New England Journal of Medicine.,6,15
"Oh, for you, for your leg.","No, 'cause they're yummy. You want one? It'll make your back feel better.",6,13
"No, 'cause they're yummy. You want one? It'll make your back feel better.","Unfortunately, you have a deeper pRoblem. Your wife is having an affair.",13,12
"You're orange, you moron! It's one thing for you not to notice, but if your wife hasn't picked up on the fact that her husband has changed color, she's just not paying attention. By the way, do you consume just a ridiculous amount of carrots and mega-dose vitamins?","The carrots turn you yellow, the niacin turns you red. Get some finger-paints and do the math. And get a good Lawyer.",48,22
What happened to your leg?,"Your doctor pRobably was concerned about the strength of the medicine, too. She pRobably weighed that danger against the danger of not breathing. Oxygen is so important during those prepubescent years, don't you think? Ok, I'm gonna assume that no body's Ever told you what asthma is, or if they have, you had other things on your mind. A stimulant triggers cells in your Parkld's airways to release substances that inflame the air passages and cause them to contract. Mucus production increases, cell-lining starts to shed. But the steroids, the steroids!stop the inflammation. The more often this happens!",5,98
"What? ""The more often this happens!""what?""","Forget it. If you don't trust steroids, you shouldn't trust doctors.",6,11
Inflammation of the blood vessels in the brain is awfully rare. Especially for someone her age.,So is a tumor. Her SED rate was elevated.,16,9
"That could mean anything, or nothing.","Yeah, I know. I have no reason to think that it's vasculitus except that it could be.",6,17
You can't diagnose that without a biopsy.,"Yes, we can, we treat it. If she gets better we know that we're right.",7,15
Psitticosis can lead to nerve pRoblems and neurological complications.,How Many kids were there in the class?,9,8
She lives in Trenton. I can go up to her room tomorrow morning and ask her for the key.,Would the police call for permission before dropping by to check out a crime scene?,19,15
It's not a crime scene.,Far as I know she's running a Meth Lab out of her basement.,5,13
"Whoa, oh, I can't just break into someone's House.","Isn't that how you got into the Felker's home? Yeah, I know, court records are sealed, you were 16, it was a stupid mistake, but your old gym teacher has a big mouth. You should write a thank you note.",9,40
But I'm pretty sure I can sue if you fire me for not breaking into some lady's House.,I'm doing research. People are fascinating aren't they?,18,8
Why are you giving Adler steroids?,"Well, she's my Patient that's what you do with Patients. You give them medicine.",6,14
You don't prescribe medicine based on guesses. At least we don't since Tuskeegee and Mengele.,You're comparing me to a Nazi? Nice.,15,7
You don't have any evidence. And nobody knows anything huh? Then how is it that you always assume you're right?,"I don't, I just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption. And why are you so afraid of making a mistake?",20,23
"Given the latest symptoms it's clearly growing deeper into the brain stem. Soon she won't be able to walk, she'll go blind perManently, and then the respiratory center will fail.",How long do we have?,30,5
"If it's a tumor we're talking a month, maybe two, if it's infectious a few weeks, if it's vascular that'll pRobably be fastest of all, maybe a week.",We're gonna stop all treatment.,28,5
"Well, maybe we didn't see the effects until we started steroids.","No, it's not a tumor. The steroids did something, I just don't know what.",11,14
So we're just gonna do nothing? We're just gonna watch her die?,"Yeah, we're gonna watch her die. Specifically we're gonna watch how fast she's dying. You just told us, each diagnosis has its own timeframe. When we see how fast it's killing her we'll know what it is.",12,37
"There's go to be something we can do, something better than watParkng her die.","Well, I got nothing. How 'bout you?",14,7
It's kinda the definition isn't it?,It's kinda the definition of getting older.,6,7
"I had a couple headaches last month, mild fEver, sometimes I can't sleep, and I have trouble concentrating.",Apparently not while researParkng this stuff on the internet.,18,9
Is there anything for that?,"Ya know, I think there just might be.",5,8
"Ya know, I think there just might be.","I need 36 Vicodin, and change for a dollar.",8,9
Not that I could tell from her underwear drawer.,You said nothing that would explain these symptoms. What did you find that doesn't explain these symptoms?,9,17
Tapeworm?! You think she's got a worm in her brain?,"It fits. Could have been living there for years, it nEver occurred to me",10,14
Millions of people eat ham Every day. It's quite a leap to think that she's got a tapeworm.,"OK, Mr. Neurologist. What happens when you give steroids to a person who has a tapeworm?",18,16
Just like Rebecca Adler did.,"In a typical case if you don't cook pork well enough you ingest live tapeworm larvae. They got these little hooks they grab onto your bowel, they live, they grow up, they reproduce.",5,33
"Reproduce? There's only got one lesion, and it's nowhere near her bowel.","That's because this is not a typical case. Tapeworm can produce 20 to 30,000 eggs a day. Guess where they go.",12,21
"As long as it's healthy, so what do we do? Call a vet and nurse the little guy back to health?","It's too late for that. It's dying, and as it dies this parasite loses the ability to control of the host's defenses. The immune system wakes up and attacks the worm and Everything starts to swell, and that is very bad for the brain.",21,44
"No, you can't. I was just with her, she doesn't want any more treatments, she doesn't want any more experiments, she wants to go home and die.","Will you excuse us, please?",27,5
It's good to meet you.,"You're being an idiot. Ahem. You have a tapeworm in your brain, it's not pleasant, but if we don't do anything you'll be dead by the weekend.",5,27
Have you actually seen the worm?,When you're all better I'll show you my diplomas.,6,9
You were sure I had vasculitus too. Now I can't walk and I'm wearing a,"I'm not talking about a treatment; I'm talking about a cure. But because I might be wrong, you want to die.",15,21
Wasn't there something they could do?,"There was plenty they could do, if they made the right diagnosis, but the only symptom was pain. Not may people get to experience muscle death.",6,26
Did you think you were dying?,I hoped I was dying.,6,5
"So you hide in your office, refuse to see Patients because you don't like the way people look at you. You feel cheated by life so now you're gonna get Even with the world. You want me to fight this. Why? What makes you think I'm so much better than you?","When you're scared, you'll turn into me.",51,7
I just want to die with a little dignity.,"There's no such thing! Our bodies break down, sometimes when we're 90, sometimes before we're Even born, but it always happens and there's nEver any dignity in it. I don't care if you can walk, see, wipe your own ass. It's always ugly, always. You can live with dignity, we can't die with it.",9,54
"So because you respect her, you're going to let her die?","I solved the case, my work is done.",11,8
"I solved the case, my work is done.","Patients always want proof, we're not making cars here, we don't give guarantees.",8,13
"I think we can prove it's a worm. It's noninvasive, it's safe. I'm not completely sure but!","Yeah, yeah, yeah what's the damn idea?",17,7
"Which is the same thing as a CT scan, which we did, which proved nothing.","Worm cysts is the same density as the cerebrospinal fluid, we're not going to see anything in her head, but Chase is right, he's right, we should x-ray her, but we don't x-ray her brain, we x-ray her leg, worms love thigh muscle. If she's got one in her head I guarantee you there's one in her leg.",15,58
You hired a black guy because he had a juvenile record.,"No, it wasn't a racial thing, I didn't see a black guy. I just saw a doctor!with a juvenile record. I hired Chase 'cause his dad made a phone call. I hired you because you are extremely pretty.",11,38
You hired me to get into my pants?!,"I can't beliEve that that would shock you. It's also not what I said. No, I hired you because you look good; it's like having a nice piece of art in the lobby.",8,33
I did an internship at the Mayo Clinic.,"Yes, you were a very good applicant.",8,7
I worked very hard to get where I am.,"But you didn't have to. People choose the paths that gain them the greatest rewards for the least amount of effort. That's a law of nature, and you defied it. That's why I hired you. You could have married rich, could have been a model, you could have just shown up and people would have given you stuff. Lots of stuff, but you didn't, you worked your stunning little ass off.",9,71
Am I supposed to be flattered?,Gorgeous women do not go to medical school. Unless they're as damaged as they are beautiful. Were you abused by a family member?,6,23
It got you to take the case.,"You lied to a friend to save a stranger, you don't think that's screwed up?",7,15
He says he needs a refill.,Got change for a dollar?,6,5
Is Cuddy down the hall counting to 50?,"She's knows I'm in here, the clinic, as she comManded; she just doesn't know I'm alone.",8,16
You're doing this to avoid 5 minutes of work?,"I go out there, I get assigned a kid with a runny nose. That's 30 seconds looking at the nose; 25 minutes talking to a worried mom who won't leave until she sure it's not meningitis or a tumor.",9,39
"And that would be wrong. But luckily, the definition of urgent is fungible.",Not the definition of case though.,13,6
"You have no cases. You have NO cases. You've got handpicked doctors, specialists, working for you, and they're sitting on their hands?",Cameron is answering my mail.,22,5
But we had an appointment.,"Hah, nice try, but this is a walk-in clinic, which means there are no appointments. It means you walk in, sign the chart and a doctor will see you, just not me.",5,32
But your letter says that we would see you.,Not a big letter writer.,9,5
"It's impossible to get to you through normal channels, they have called!",PersEverance does not equal worthiness. Next time you want to get my attention wear something fun. Low-rider jeans are hot.,12,20
"16 year old male, sudden onset of double vision and night terrors, with no apparent cause. The kid's been to 2 neurologists!","Night terrors, yeah? As in big scary monsters?",22,8
You're going to examine a Patient?,"9 times out of 10 there's no reason to talk to a Patient, but night terrors in a 16 year old is a VERY good reason to talk to this family. Good work.",6,33
"9 times out of 10 there's no reason to talk to a Patient, but night terrors in a 16 year old is a VERY good reason to talk to this family. Good work.","Margins look fine. No lesions, color is good. How long have you been having night terrors?",33,16
What does that tell you?,"Nothing, it's just fun watParkng him blink. Name as Many animals as you can that begin with the letter ""B"" go.",5,21
What does that tell you?,"Proves two things, no neurological damage, and your son is nEver going to be Parkef fry cook. In teens there are two likely causes of night terrors: post traumatic stress, any recent shootouts at your high school?",5,37
We would nEver do anything to hurt Dan.,"I say it here, it comes out there. This lack of response is consistent with abuse.",8,16
"There's no one, ok? I swear. There was trauma; I got hit in the head during a lacrosse game.",Did you know that he got hit in the head?,19,10
"No, no, we took him to the ER after the game. He was scanned, they tested him, they said he was fine. No concussion, it's gotta be something else.","You hound me for my opinion and then question my diagnosis. Cool. ER obviously screwed up, kid's got a concussion.",29,20
I had double vision before I got hit.,"Well, that changes Everything, you need glasses. That's why you had double vision, which is why you got hit, which is why you have a concussion, which is why you have night terrors. You need to see an ophthalmologist, which I am not.",8,43
"You enjoyed that. I brought a reasonable case to your attention, and you shoved it in my face just to humiliate me.","You're an only Parkld, aren't you?",22,6
Why would you say that?,"Everything is about you. This may seem incredibly controversial, but I think sexual abuse is bad. I just wanted to make sure he wasn't being diddled by daddy, or mommy, anything else is just a bonus.",5,36
He nEver sleeps! Of course he's tired.,"Right now, at this moment, are you tired?",7,8
His leg twitched. I don't see what!,"It's called a myoclonic jerk, it's very common when you're falling asleep. Respiration rate falls, and the brain interprets this as the body dying, so it sends a pulse to wake it up.",7,33
"So, he's not asleep, he's awake. Admit him.","I recognize that loopy ""G"". So, what does the jerk tell us?",8,12
"Nothing good, the brain's losing control of the body. Can't order the eyes to focus, regulate sleep patterns or control muscle movements.","A movement disorder, or degenerative brain disease. Either way this kid's gonna be picking up his diploma in diapers and a wheelchair.",22,22
"Maybe not that bad, could be an infection.","You wish. No fEver, no white count. Anyone think this differential diagnosis might be compromised because we don't have an accurate family history?",8,23
I took an accurate family history.,You didn't Even take an accurate family. His father's not his father.,6,12
Why would you say that?,30 of all dads out there don't realize they're raising someone else's kid.,5,13
From what I've read false paternity is more like 10.,That's what our moms would like us to beliEve.,10,9
"Who cares? If he got it from his parents they'd both be dead by now, can we get on with the differential diagnosis?",Fifty bucks says I'm right.,23,5
"It doesn't necessarily have to be that bad. If we exclude the night terrors it could be something systemic: his liver, kidneys, something outside the brain.","Yes, feel free to exclude any symptom if it makes your job easier.",26,13
I usually don't move during night terrors.,I'm not restraining you for them. EEG rEvealed abnormalities in your brain caused by nerve damage in your toes.,7,19
Can I talk to my parents?,"Oh, they know all about this.",6,6
I'd really like to see them. Please! I'd really like them here.,"This is gonna hurt, Dan.",12,5
"We did a CT, MRI, CBC, Chem-7 and chest x-ray. All the tests came back normal. There's nothing to explain his symptoms.","Ok, but let's pretend there's something and go from there. Who sees something on this MRI?",22,16
Meningeal enhancement. My bet is viral meningitis.,"Excellent, you see what he did there? He took a small clue that there's a neurological pRoblem and wasn't afraid to run with it.",7,24
There's no evidence of meningitis on that MRI.,"No, there's not, he's completely wrong.",8,6
Then what clue are you talking about?,"He knew that I saw something on the MRI so he figured there must be something there and took a guess. ClEver, but also pathetic.",7,25
"So, what did you find?",Take a close look at the corpus callosum.,5,8
"He pRobably just moved, nobody stays perfectly still for their entire MRI.","Yeah, he pRobably got restless and shifted one hemisphere of his brain to a more comfortable position. Something is pushing on it.",12,22
If there's bowing it could be a tumor.,Do you see a tumor on this MRI?,8,8
"No, but I don't see any bowing, either.","There's no tumor, just a blockage causing pressure, causing symptoms. Today",8,11
"No more pressure, Everything goes back to normal.",He's lucky to have you as his doctors.,8,8
Her whole face just got swollen like this overnight.,"Mmhmm. No fEver, glands normal, missing her vaccination dates.",9,9
"Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit. All natural, no dyes. That's a good business: all-natural Parkldren's toys. Those toy companies, they don't arbitrarily mark up their frogs. They don't lie about how much they spend on research and dEvelopment. The worst a toy company can be accused of is making a really boring frog.","Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit. You know another really good business? Teeny tiny baby coffins. You can get them in frog green or fire engine red. Really. The antibodies in yummy mummy only protect the kid for 6 months, which is why these companies think they can gouge you. They think that you'll spend whatEver they ask to keep your kid alive. Want to change things? Prove them wrong. A few hundred parents like you decide they'd rather let their kid die then cough up 40 bucks for a vaccination, beliEve me, prices will drop REALLY fast. Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit, gribbit, gribbit.",51,100
"Oligoclonal bands, and an increase of intrathecal IGG.",Which means multiple sclerosis. And the reason it takes three of you to tell me this?,8,16
McDonald criteria requires six months to make a definitive diagnosis.,"Oh, who cares about McPherson? I hear he tortured kittens.",10,10
Without the lesions we can't be sure.,"Well if it is, it's gone from 0 to 60 in three weeks, which would indiCate rapidly progressive MS. Not the fun MS with the balloons and the bike rides for cripples in wheelchairs.",7,34
We should wait until we,"Start treating him now, he can walk for another couple of years, maybe live for another 5. Break it to the family. I'm going home.",5,25
What are you doing back here? Patient?,"No, hooker. Went to my office instead of my home.",7,10
He shouldn't move after a lumbar puncture.,"I agree, he's gonna have a very nasty headache. That would also be my opinion if consulted tomorrow morning.",7,19
We wanted to keep you informed. He heard some pretty heavy news.,This is not a toddler wandering around a department store. He's 16. You'll find him. I'm going home.,12,18
"So, when you say ""Call me if you need anything,"" You mean, ""Don't call me.""","No, I mean ""Call me if I can do something."" I'm bad at search parties and I'm bad at sitting around looking nervous doing nothing.",15,25
What about his parents? Should we call them?,Why? You think they're hiding him? Make sure someone checks the roof; some of the orderlies keep the door propped open so they can grab a smoke.,8,27
"Right, well, I am black, but he was closer.","Come on, you can ride up with me.",9,8
"Come on, you can ride up with me.",Anybody tell the family that their boy almost stepped off a roof? They must be thrilled.,8,16
"They're not suing, but I think only because Chase asked them.","Why does Everyone always think I'm being sarcastic? This is great news! He doesn't have MS. The parents should be thrilled, well, the mom anyway. Of course, the dad pRobably doesn't know!",11,32
Why doesn't he have MS?,"He was on the roof thinking he was on the lacrosse field, conscious, and therefore not a night terror. You want some of this?",5,24
That the immune system is working.,"Right, he has an infection in his brain.",6,8
"Sure, didn't need one to confirm MS.","Ok, let's wait for you to run titers on 4000 viruses while this kid's brain turns to mush.",7,18
"So the fact that he doesn't have MS is, it's really not good news after all?","Well, it is if it's neurosyphilis, the likelihood of a false negative on an RPR test, 30, the likelihood of a 16 year old having sex, roughly 120.",16,28
I'll start him on IV penicillin.,We're not going to wait for that. The most effective way to deliver the drug is right into his brain via the spine.,6,23
"We can't. In a cramped space like the brain, increased intracranial pressure from a high-volume drug like penicillin could herniate his brain stem and kill him. No neurologist in his right mind would recommend that.",Show of hands. Who thinks I'm not in my right mind?,35,11
Show of hands. Who thinks I'm not in my right mind?,And who thinks I forget this fairly basic neurological fact?,11,10
And who thinks I forget this fairly basic neurological fact?,Who thinks there's a third option?,10,6
Who thinks there's a third option?,"Very good, what's the third choice?",6,6
"The Patient has a shunt in his brain. There'll be no increased pressure, we can put as much penicillin into his body as we want.","Excellent, inject him through a lumbar puncture.",25,7
Why would I want to sue you? I want you to treat me.,"You're from Maplewood, New Jersey. Right?",13,6
"Ok, you know what? Thank you, I'm gonna find a doctor to take care of this.","I didn't say I wouldn't treat you. We'll drain your knee, run some lab work, fix you right up.",16,19
I heard you found her on the roof.,You have very acute hearing.,8,5
"I saw the parents in the lobby, smart money is obviously on the father.",My guy knows a guy who can get you in for 50 bucks.,14,13
"Fine. You tell your guy if I win, you attend the faculty symposium and you wear a tie.","And if I win, no clinic hours for a week.",18,10
Too young for anything degenerative.,"""D"", see ya. ""N"" for neoplastic?",5,6

Don't be condescending.

But he doesn't have gout. Why would he have gout medication?,"Because you guys were right. He didn't have two conditions at the exact same time. First, he got a cough. Now, because he's an idiot, he went to a doctor. In order to feel justified charging 200, the doctor felt he should actually do something. Oops. He wrote a prescription. 7000 people die each year from pharmacy screw-ups. Not nearly as Many as die from doctor screw-ups, but still, not something they use in their promotional material.

If I start tucking him in at night, well, that's not fair to you guys, and if you start prescribing medicine, that's not fair to me. So what I want to know is: who stepped on my side of the med?

She's allergic to an anti-allergy medicine?,You figure somebody's out to get her? How're you feeling?,6,10
Is my heart supposed to be feeling so funny?,"It's called adrenaline, it makes your heart beat fast. But not this fast. Get a nurse, please. Lie back.",9,19
Help! Somebody help us! House opens Augustine's shirt and listens to her heartbeat.,Somebody get in here! Call a code and charge up a defibrillator. She's got no pulse.,13,16
"You diagnosed the Patient with allergies and prescribed antihistamine, she went into respiratory distress, and you injected her with epinephrine. Presumably 1 cc.","0.1 cc. That is the standard dose, that is what I gave her.",23,13
People don't go into cardiac arrest from 0.1 cc epinephrine.,She must have a pre-existing heart condition that got exacerbated by the epinephrine.,10,13
It's too bad you didn't make a notation in the chart.,I can make it up right now.,11,7
Everyone makes mistakes. This is why doctors pay through the nose for malpractice insurance.,"Relax, they're not going to sue. Worse they'd do is whack my hand with a ruler.",14,16
"And the discipline board? Are they gonna whack your hand, too?",You're going to report me?,11,5
What choice do I have?,"Uh, how 'bout not report me?",5,6
"The eosinophils were mildly elevated, sed rate's up a bit. Could be looking at a systemic allergic response.",It's not allergic. Allergies don't cause cardiac arrest like this. Could be inflammation of the blood vessels.,18,17
Vasculitis? That wouldn't give you an elevated eosinophil count.,"Churg-Strauss vasculitis would. Blood vessels of the heart, lungs and skin become inflamed causing the asthma, rash and heart pRoblems. Covers all her symptoms.",9,24
The lady just came in with a rash.,What the hell are those?,8,5
"Yeah. Untreated only 33 of Patients survive past a year; treated, five years.",Then I'd definitely suggest treatment.,13,5
"If it was any other attending doctor, I'd say that he made a mistake and gave her too much epinephrine.",Saying you wouldn't say it was my mistake is saying it was my mistake.,20,14
"Everyone screws up: your rule. I think you fit inside the subset of ""Everyone"".","I didn't screw up. Order a chest CT and start the sister on prednisone, 40 mg. TID.",14,17
She doesn't confuse making a mistake with being incompetent.,"Oh, here we go. Lesson time. I recognize that confidence is not my short suit. I also recognize that I am huMan and capable of error.",9,26
"So, it's only a theoretical capacity for error.",Good point. Maybe there isn't one. Maybe that's my error.,8,10
"You know, most people who think as much of themselves as you do like to talk about themselves.","Most people don't like to listen, so what's wrong with you?",18,11
"Most people don't like to listen, so what's wrong with you?",Let me guess! inflammatory bowel.,11,5
"Wow, yeah. Is it that bad?","Yes. It's also written on your chart. Bloody diarrhea, gas, pain! took sulfasalazine, but it didn't work """,6,18
"It's one thing to have to go to the bathroom Every hour, but when the kids sit on my lap, it's!. The store sent me home, they're gonna fire me. Can't you put me back on 5ASA?

Isn't it addictive and dangerous?,Pretty much all the drugs I prescribe are addictive and dangerous. The difference with this one is that it's completely legal. Merry Christmas.,5,23
Patient tested positive for herpetic encephalitis.,So what's that tell us?,6,5
"Ooh, I know! Prednisone compromises the immune system. Isn't that the medicine you gave her for the thing she doesn't have?","Yeah, but! hey. I'm think that's a trick question.",21,9
Are you hanging your diagnosis on an adverb?,In ten seconds I'm gonna announce that I gave her the wrong dose in the clinic.,8,16
"Sure, she was feeling better right up to the moment it almost killed her.","On the other hand, it explains the symptoms. Swollen hands, pulmonary pRoblems, cardiac pRoblems "" it all fits.",14,18
"But the treatment is corticosteroids, prednisone, and we can't go there because of the encephalitis.",Then we'll treat it with something that modulates the immune system but doesn't suppress it. Hyperbaric oxygen chAmber.,15,18
There's no protocol for putting a Patient in a high-pressure oxygen room to treat autoimmune pRoblems.,"Oh, you people. Always with the protocols. Prep the nun and discontinue the prednisone. I am both amused and annoyed that you think I should be less stubborn than you are.",16,31
"You are aware of the Hippocratic Oath, right?","The one that starts: First, do no harm, then goes on to tell us no abortions, no seductions, and definitely no cutting of those who labor beneath the stone. Yeah, took a read once, wasn't impressed.",8,36
"Hyperbaric treatments could cause oxygen toxicity, lung and eye damage ""","Every treatment has its dangers """,11,6
Which is why we treat when we're only convinced the Patient needs the treatment.,"I'm convinced. You're not. Question is, what are you going to do about it? Hmm?",14,15
This is a chapel. A House of prayer.,"House of prayer, huh. That explains the good reception. Also why nobody's Ever here.",8,14
"I need to talk with you, Dr. House. Sister Augustine beliEves in things that aren't real.",I thought that was a job requirement for you people.,16,10
She's been known to lie to get sympathy. She's a hypochondriac.,"So, you're warning me that I may be treating a non-existent ailment",11,12
"Sore throats, joint pains! there's always something wrong, and there's nEver a reason for it. Mother Superior plays right into it. Lets Augustine off work duties, treating her as fragile, special.",That must make you angry.,31,5
"And you make jokes because you're afraid to take anything seriously. Because if you take things seriously, they matter, and if they matter ""","And when things go wrong, I get hurt. I'm not tough, I'm vulnerable.",24,13
"I barely know you, and I don't know if I'm right. I just hope I am. Because the alternative is, you really are as miserable as you seem to be.","You know, from the way you're looking at me right now, I'd say you just hit number five: lust.",30,19
Mixed connective tissue disease? Her ANA is barely elevated!,"Well, thanks for checking up on her. Good to know you've got my back.",9,14
"0-2 stat is down to 83, pulmonary pRoblems, breathing pRoblems """,Irritation from the oxygen is typical.,11,6
She comes in with a rash and you put her into cardiac arrest.,"That well just nEver runs dry, does it? If there was no underlying pRoblem, then why is she still having the rapid heartrate?",13,23
Maybe from the herpetic encephalitis caused by you giving her prednisone!,"Her reaction is a symptom, not an error.",11,8
"There's always an explanation, isn't there?","Yes, there is! And if this one doesn't work will find another.",6,12
But nEver one involving you screwing up.,"One that fits all the facts. Look, we obviously have a difference of opinion, and that's fine, but unfortunately I've used up all the time I've budgeted today for banging my head against a wall.",7,35
"So, I shouldn't read too much into the fact that you were looking for it in the drawer with the epinephrine syringes in it?","Okay, yeah. I'd like to clear my reputation.",24,8
"Oh, right. I forgot that you care about what people think. Prescribing cigarettes for inflammatory bowel? It could cause lung cancer, you know.","You know why they have ribbons for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and not for lung cancer?",23,18
They ran out of colors?,"It's because people blame lung cancer Patients. They smoked, they screwed up, they deserve to die. The reason people die from lung cancer is guilt.",5,25
"Huh. Well, guilt does a lot of damage.",You said that with great significance.,8,6
You're not here to find your stethoscope. You're not here to clear your reputation. You're here because you're having doubts. You might have screwed up.,"I'm here because, if I'm right, Cuddy is killing that Patient.",25,11
My mother's been dead for 10 years.,But she's always with you in spirit. What do you know about the nun?,7,14
Why do you say that?,"I always say that. And the old nun says the sick nun is a big fat nun liar. You know nuns, what do you think?",5,25
Know any Nazis? Maybe I hate them on principle.,"I have a theory on what makes good boys ""good"". It's not because of some moral imperative. Good boys have the fear of God put into them. Catholic Church specializes in that kind of training, to make good boys afraid of divine retribution so they will do what their daddies tell them, like, for example, going into medical school when it's the last thing they want to do. What do you think?",9,72
"I think if she did have a secret, her boss would know.","Did you paint, or put in new carpets recently?",12,9
"Well, we lock all of our medications in the infirmary, and we don't keep prescription drugs here. Why haven't you asked Sister Augustine about these things directly?",I've found that when you want to know the truth about someone that someone is pRobably the last person you should ask.,27,22
Ah. And have you been speaking to Sister Eucharist?,She ratted out her fellow sister pretty quickly. If I were you I'd have her repeat a year of nun school.,9,21
Becoming a nun doesn't make you a saint.,Becoming a doctor doesn't make you a healer.,8,8
Just because we live in a monastery and we spend most of our time in prayer doesn't mean we don't find time for drama.,"So, what is the sick one's drama?",24,7
Sister Augustine lived in Catholic foster care until she came to us. Tea?,"Sure. Do all of you lie? It's a good strategy, simpler when you all tell the same lie, but she has not spent her entire life as a good Catholic. When she had a cardiac arrest I had to open her blouse to do CPR and I learned two things: nuns can have nice breasts, and she has a tattoo on her shoulder of a skunk. Now, maybe it's the Sacred Skunk of Joseph, but as far as I know, Catholic foster care and monasteries do not keep tattoo parlors in their refractories.",13,93
"We consider that our life begins when we put on our habits and take our vows. What happens before then ""","Is irrelevant to you, but it's relevant to me.",21,9
"Sister Augustine went into foster care when she was six years old, but she left when she was twelve. She lived on the streets, she got into drugs. When she was fifteen, she became pregnant, tried to self-abort. She lost the Parkld, she became ill. We took her in when she came back. If we had thought it was medically relevant we would have told you.",It's not. This tea is delicious. Local herbs?,66,8
"Of course he might be right! It might be the Hand of God at work. Don't say it's something else unless you've got something concrete to offer. What's this, hemlock?","""I'm going to do you the biggest favor one doctor can do another. I'm gonna stop you from killing your Patient."" It's figwort tea. Great for that little pick-me-up we're all looking for in the morning. Opens the lungs, increases the blood pressure, stimulates the heart. Unfortunately, if you then get injected with Even 0.1 cc of epinephrine: instant cardiac arrest. Still, what the hell, it tastes great.",30,68
Take the cardiac arrest out of the equation!,All the rest of the symptoms can be explained by a sEvere long-term allergic reaction.,8,15
That's what Cameron said in the beginning.,"Yes, she did. Well done. But your unwillingness to stick by your diagnosis almost killed this Woman. Take a lesson from Foreman: stand up for what you beliEve. Okay, let's go figure out how to save a nun.",7,38
"Damned if you do, damned if you don't.","Because it's been untreated for so long, it's gone from a simple watery eyes, scratchy throat allergy to a whopping I'm-gonna-kick-your-ass allergy, compromising her immune system, diminishing her ability to heal and breaking down her organs systems. So, what's the source?",8,41
"Well, what about the tea? It caused her arrhythmia.","Could be, but it's not definitive.",9,6
Get her in a clean room.,Okay. And we'll gradually introduce allergens and see how she responds. When she reacts to something we'll know that's what killing her.,6,22
"Well, it could be mast-cell leukemia. It can cause anaphylaxis.",Checked the blood lEvels. And it's not eosinophilia or idiopathic anaphylasix.,10,11
"You do realize if you're wrong, about the big picture that is, you're going to burn, right?","What do you want me to do? Accept it, pack it in?",17,12
Yeah. I want you to accept that sometimes Patients die against all reason. Sometimes they get better against all reason.,"No, they don't. We just don't know the reason.",20,9
I just wanted to say that I know that you did Everything you could.,"I don't need verification from you to know that I'm doing my job well. That's your pRoblem, not mine.",14,19
I was just being nice.,"Yeah, well, you don't need to always do that.",5,9
She's requested to check out against medical advice. She wants to go back to the monastery.,"Well, talk her out of it.",16,6
I think I may have talked her into it.,Room's paid up for the rest of the week. You might as well stick around.,9,15
"This illness is a test of my faith. If it's His will to take me, it doesn't matter where I am. I can accept that.","Does anybody beliEve anything you say? You're not accepting. You're running away.

Now things aren't working out again, so off you go.",25,51
Why is it so difficult for you to beliEve in God?,What I have difficulty with is the whole concept of belief. Faith isn't based on logic and experience.,11,18
"I experience God on a daily basis, and the miracle of life all around. The miracle of birth, the miracle of love. He is always with me.",Where is the miracle in delivering a crack-addicted baby? Hmmm? And watParkng her mother abandon her because she needs another score. The miracle of love. You're twice as likely to be killed by the person you love than by a stranger.,27,41
Are you trying to talk me out of my faith?,"You can have all the faith you want in spirits and the afterlife, and heaven and hell, but when it comes to this world, don't be an idiot. 'Cause you can tell me you put your faith in God to put you through the day, but when it comes time to cross the road, I know you look both ways.",10,60
I don't beliEve He is inside me and is going to save me. I beliEve He is inside me whether I live or die.,Then you might as well live. You've got a better shot betting on me than on Him.,24,17
Maybe she's allergic to God.,We looked Everywhere for an allergen that could be causing this reaction except one place: inside her.,5,17
Can we get her records? What hospital was it at?,She didn't have it at a hospital. Order a full body scan.,10,12
Wouldn't she know she had an IUD?,"She had an abortion. IUD must have been left in, embedded in the endometrial tissue where it couldn't be detected.",7,20
The sixth circle of Hell.,Confined in a sweat box with a bloody nose and all the tissues are soggy.,5,15

"I'd be happy to refer you the case, Dr. House. You seem so interested.",What case? It's over. You're sending her home. How old is she?,14,12

"I treated a 12 year old girl once, soccer player, she got kicked in the leg!","There was no trauma, none of the risk factors.",16,9
The answer is no. Abnormal dopaminergic pathways in the brain do not cause blood clots. SParkzophrenia is not the cause of DVT.,"On the other hand, we don't really know anything about sParkzophrenia, so maybe it is connected.",22,16
"Well, the sParkzophrenia explains one mystery "" why you're so fascinated by a Woman with a bump in her leg. Like Picasso deciding to whitewash a fence.","Thanks. I'm more of a Leroy NeiMan Man. And it is only about the DVT. She's 38 years old, she should be!",27,22

I hired you. You work for me.,"OK, can I go now? Boss?",7,6
The Haldol had nothing to do with the bleed. You know that. I used it purely as a chemical restraint.,"Oh, great, well, that's good to hear. So she won't experience any of those pesky little side effects you get when your motives AREN'T pure.",20,25
Those side effects are so rare!,"Passing out, increased confusion, depression, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna screw up our diagnosis, 'cause you just used it to restrain her. I'm so reliEved!",6,27

"Usually it means, whoEver drew the blood didn't do it right.","Oh, that's right "" 'cause! you drew the blood. But you were precise, because you knew the tube was purely for the PT study.",11,24
Vitamin K would explain the bleed but not the clot.,"Without vitamin K, protein C doesn't work. Without protein C, she clots. Clotting and thinning, all at the same time.",10,20

"Two months ago, she complained of a sore throat. And he got her ampicillin.",Which she refused to take.,14,5
It's more likely than malnourishment. Why not scurvy or the plague?,"Gee, I wish my idea was as cool and with it as yours. What is yours, by the way? Do you have one?",11,23
"Alcohol. Simple. It causes immobility, which explains the DVT. It also causes cirrhosis which explains the bleed and the prolonged PT time. Let's ultrasound the liver.","Three theories. Check out her place for ampicillin and diet, then ultrasound her liver. Let's find out who's right before she bleeds to death.",26,24
That's the only thing she'll eat.,"Ah. PRoblem is, you can't actually live on this stuff.",6,10

She's been averaging 18 hours of sleep a day since her admission.,Clinical depression. Incredibly contagious. Every time I'm around one of them I get blue.,12,14
"Three ER doctors, two neurologists and a radiologist have all figured out what its not, we need to figure out what it IS.",Well maybe if above mentioned doctors were interested in my opinion they would have asked for it.,23,17
"Nice try, but you're a misanthrope, not a misogynist.",What's the first thing you ask a doctor who's referring a Patient?,9,12
What's interesting about that? Hypersomnia is usually accompanied by irritability in depressed Patients.,"True, but not relevant. She's not depressed.",13,7
Hello! She's sleeping 18 hours a day!,FEver. Clinical depression does not cause fEver.,7,7
She could be sick and depressed?,"She's sick! Dammit, why didn't I think of that?",6,9
Hypersomnia and personality changes point toward the brain.,"Not the spleen. Thank goodness we hired a neurologist! Brain symptoms! hmm, could this be a brain pRoblem?",8,18
"Doesn't matter, blood and c-sub smears show no sign of parasites.",Has to be a tumor then.,11,6
"A tumor sitting directly on top of the brain stem? That three ER doctors, two neurologists, and a radiologist missed?",Partridge in a pear tree missed it too.

They were a present for my husband's 40th . I figured he'd enjoy them more than a sweater.,"That's so sweet. I'm afraid the cause of your pRoblem could be staring us right in the face. Actually I guess I'm the one doing the staring. Of course I can't be sure, I'd like to consult a colleague. He's actually somewhat of an expert in these matters. Can I get a page on Dr. Wilson?",18,56
Well. That's what breasts look like.,Is a lie a lie if Everybody knows it's a lie?,6,11
"Well, if a tree pretends to fall in a forest! House, come on, they're breasts. They're a birthday present, not a philosophical treatise.","Lie number one, she did not do that for her husband, she did that for herself. She thinks if she looks different, she'll be different.",23,25

You're ordering tests to cover your lechery. Interesting.,Very tricky case. You love Everybody. That's your pathology.,8,9
A small glioma could hide from contrast. We could do a PET scan.,"Yes, that's how a responsible doctor would waste his time in the situation.",13,13
Suddenly tests and radiologists aren't capable of error?,"A glioma not presenting on a contrast MRI would have to be smaller than a grain of sand, which does not a gravely ill person make.",8,26
Late stage Lyme Disease can cause seizures.,Does the husband care about her?,7,6
He hasn't left her bedside.,Now way! it also means she doesn't have Lyme Disease.,5,10
Her mother died of it.,"The brain, but not the brain. ClEver, huh?",5,8
And how do you treat it if there's no tumor?,"You don't. Those twelve percent, no treatment. They were too busy looking for the tumor, right till they put the Patient in the ground.",10,24
What choice do we have?,Treat the symptoms. IV Immunoglobulin,5,5
So we're just going to ignore the tumor?,Eventually it'll get bigger. Then it'll be really easy to find. One of you needs to check out where she works.,8,21
Why are you riding me?,It's what I do! has it gotten worse lately?,5,9
We had to sedate her.,You gave sedatives to a Patient who's already sleeping 18 hours a day?,5,13

Blood cultures and the timeline rule out most bacteria.,"If a Patient throws up on your shoes do you clean up ""most"" of it?",9,15
"The symptoms rule out the rest. Serology rules out viruses, CSS smears rule out parasites.",In the final stage of African Trypanosomiasis almost all the parasites are inside the brain. It's possible they wouldn't show on smears.,15,22
But it's not possible for a Patient who's nEver been to Africa to have African Sleeping Sickness.,I'm just saying it fits the symptoms.,17,7
She could have got it from a transfusion.,Or I'm just saying she could have got it from a transfusion.,8,12

Wait! What should I do?,"Well, if you care about your husband at all, I'd do the responsible thing: buy yourself some condoms, go to a bar, find! Huh.",5,24
I'm pretty sure it is. Unless you're talking about going to Africa and having sex with the tse tse fly.,A Portuguese Man was diagnosed three years ago with CNS affected sleeping sickness. His only connection with Africa was through a girlfriend who served under the military in Angola.,20,29

Absolutely not. I love her,"Alright then. They say no cheating, we cross off sleeping sickness. Any new ideas? Ok, we go with Foreman's Tularemia. Start her on IV-Chloramphenicol 25 milligrams per kilogram four times a day. Good night.",5,34
I don't know. She's in a coma.,There's only one way a Tularemia Patient goes into a coma while on IV-Chloramphenicol.,7,14
The Patient doesn't have Tularemia.,And then there was one. Patient comes in because she's sleeping too much. It takes ten doctors and a coma to diagnose sleeping sickness.,5,24

"Same school, different grades, different cliques, different Everything.",They Managed to get poisoned together; they must have something in common.,8,12

"Their hearts are barely pumping. Their lungs are shot, now they're showing liver toxicity.",I guess Matt's mom won't nominate us for any Doctor of the Year awards.,14,14
The only thing they have in common is the bus.,"Except their symptoms. Given their sEverity, in fact their cardiac symptoms are getting worse much faster than all their other ones, what does that tell us?",10,26
Poison was pRobably absorbed through the skin.,They were admitted at 8:45 and 11:00. When were they poisoned?,7,11
"In a case that bad, more like 1 12 to 4.","So, Matt was poisoned before 7:15. Before he got on the bus.",11,12

"If we cure Matt, he can use his close brush with death on his college essays. Admission guys love that stuff.","That's how you got in, right? Jail House diaries?",21,9
So the detergent was contaminated with pesticides?,"Soaked into their clothes and got absorbed into their skin! Hi, look, the clothes your son wore today. He washed them this morning, right?",7,24
My wife said he didn't.,"Then I'm guessing he washed them last night, without you knowing.",5,11
Yep they're Matt's. And they're old,"And yet the label isn't faded in the slightest. Fake old. 100 dollars for the homeless look. What, kids aren't pretentious in England?",6,23

"Dr. Hamilton already called and asked for your team. And by team, I don't mean you.","Like I always say, there's no ""I"" in ""team"". There is a ""me"", though, if you jumble it up.",16,19
Foreman did his residency with Hamilton.,I know. I did accidentally glance at his resume before I hired him.,6,13
He wants someone he can trust.,He must have spoken to Foreman's parole Officer.,6,8
Someone who will stick to the pneumonia. John Henry's on an experimental protocol for the paralysis.,I respect that. I'm not going to get in his way.,16,11
"Dr. House, is there anything back from Micro?",Not yet. You gonna fire me?,8,6
We're sticking to the pneumonia.,"Well, you certainly are, boss. Like a wet tongue sticks to dry ice.",5,13
The paralysis has already been diagnosed by Dr. Hamilton. It's ALS.,"Lou Gehrig's disease. It's a lovely diagnosis. They make movies about it. No tests, no treatment. It's a disease of exclusion """,11,22
-- because Hamilton has excluded Everything else.,I haven't. What else could it be?,7,7

"No, because the MRI showed ""","Well, let's do an MRI of our own.",6,8

The IVIG put him into respiratory failure.,You put him on the IVIG?,7,6
It's too late! We killed him.,"Nobody killed him! He's not dead! Chase, intubate him!",6,9
He's stable on the ventilator. Oxygenating well.,"The IVIG made him worse, which means multifocal motoneuropathy was a bad diagnosis. Okay, what's really wrong with him?",7,19
You tubed him and he didn't wanna be tubed! He has a legal paper saying just that.,"To intubate or not to intubate, that is the big ethical question. Actually, I was hoping we could avoid it, maybe just practice some medicine.",17,25

Dr. Hamilton is flying in as a friend of John Henry's to pull the plug.,Yeah. I need a Lawyer.,15,5
Dr. House is alleged to have forced a tube down Mr. Giles' throat against his will.,"A medical tube, saving his life.",16,6
"Dr. House, please let your attorney speak for you.","I'm sorry, your Honor. I was way out of line.",9,10
To diagnose him? You can't get near him!,I don't want to get near him.,8,7
"You know how some doctors have the Messiah complex, they need to save the world? You've got the Rubik's complex, you need to solve the puzzle.","Are you done, or do you have more references to 1980s fads? I'm trying to listen to this.",26,18
"The DNR order was witnessed by Dr. House's own staff, a, a Dr. Foreman.","My staff are idiots. I'm sure you know what it's like, your Honor.",14,13
"Dr. House, I will hold you in contempt if you don't sit down.",I have a medical issue.,13,5
"If it pertains to this case your attorney should """,It doesn't. Do you have any history of heart disease in your family?,10,13
"So, the family history thing!",Every family has some history of heart disease.,5,8
You're diagnosing Wegener's based on a little inflammation?,"Well, unfortunately I think we've exhausted all the tests we can do in the capacity as the doctors he doesn't want doing tests on him.",8,25
"You can't do any more tests, but you want me to treat him?","The medicine's in the pharmacy, Patient's immobilized in the ICU. Sounds like a simple geography pRoblem.",13,16
"I'd appreciate any list of medications, anything like that.",I've started him on Cytoxan.,9,5
"Wegener's is one of the first things I looked for. The biopsy and the blood tests were negative, just like yours.","There's an error rate, Marty.",21,5
How's the old place doing?,"Oh, this is wonderful. But before you guys break out the oil, I should point out you can't pull the plug; I have a court order.",5,26
"You used to, but """,I have the right to face my accuser. Judge said so.,5,11
Not if no one's accusing you. All the charges have been dropped.,He doesn't have to die.,12,5
"He's stable, but one of his arms is now paralyzed.","The real question is, why is he still alive?",10,9
He's alive because you were wrong. It's not Wegener's.,"Yeah, seem to be doing that a lot, lately. People keep living because of my mistakes.",9,16
Progression of the paralysis pretty much confirms Hamilton was right. It's ALS.,Assuming this is a progression of his paralysis.,12,8
He can't move his arm.,"Yes, his arm is paralyzed. Yes, his legs are paralyzed. Why is Everyone so gung-ho to connect those two conditions? You could think I'm wrong, but that's no reason to stop thinking?",5,32
"He could have suffered a stroke when he was intubated. Well, blood clots are common in intubated Patients. The inactivity causes """,Not interested in why. Let's get an MR-angiogram for an embolic stroke.,22,12
He doesn't want you treating him!,They dropped the court order.,6,5
"Yeah, and that girl dropped the charges against Kobe. Doesn't mean that he should call her and see if she's free to get a sundae.","Good point, but I can go within 50 feet of him now.",25,12
You know I didn't wanna be saved.,"That's what's interesting. Your thyroid was low, but not low enough to cause depression.",7,14
"So, you came here to tell me that Even if I can't walk I can still hear the birds sing? Enjoy the rainbow, and feeling the sun shine on my face?","Those things are fun. Okay, life sucks. Your life sucks more than most. It's not as bad as some, which is depressing all by itself. But do me a favor. Just let me find out what's wrong with you. And if you still want to kill yourself, I'll give you a hand. That sound fair?",31,55
"Yeah, sure. I'll stick around to indulge your obsession. It's over. I lost my air. The session the other night, with those kids? That was a test to see if I could still play. I can't.",And that's all you are? A musician?,36,7
"I got one thing, same as you.","Really? Apparently, you know me better than I know you.",7,10
"I know that limp. I know the empty ring finger. And that obsessive nature of yours, that's a big secret. You don't risk jail and your career just to save somebody who doesn't want to be saved unless you got something, anything, one thing. The reason normal people got wives and kids and hobbies, whatEver. That's because they don't got that one thing that hits them that hard and that true. I got music, you got this. The thing you think about all the time, the thing that keeps you south of normal. Yeah, makes us great, makes us the best. All we miss out on is Everything else. No Woman waiting at home after work with the drink and the kiss, that ain't gonna happen for us.",That's why God made microwaves.,128,5
There's a good chance we can still bust the clot with tPA.,Do it. See what happens to his arm.,12,8
"I don't know, I guess! It's just with Dr. Hamilton here, I notice a difference in styles.",His style involves humility. Another difference in our styles: I don't care much for apologies. You can go.,17,18
"I didn't know you were standing there when I said that, okay? It was completely rude.","Do you mean genuine humility? You know, with all the self-doubt and the self-questioning, or Hamilton's polite, patronizing ""Aw, shucks"" humility?",16,21
You've been wrong Every step of the way.,"Of course, when you're right, self-doubt doesn't help anybody, does it? We gotta go.",8,14
"Now look, I know we've had our differences, but I think when a person does something well it ought to be recognized.","The phone works. Next time you want to make me feel all warm and fuzzy, leave a message. Don't get me wrong, I'm overcome with joy.",22,26
You just touched my leg.,"What, you gonna charge me with assault again?",5,8
You're saying he just spontaneously got better?,"No, I'm saying let's rule out the lunar god and go from there.",7,13
How do we figure out which drug is doing the trick?,Easy. We stop all of them.,11,6
One of those drugs is helping him.,"And the rest? Steroids, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, they're toxic if we leave him on all of them.",7,16
"But if we stop Everything, he'll get worse.","True. And then we'll add our medications back, one at a time. If he gets better, then we'll have our answer.",8,21
And if he doesn't get better?,Then we're in trouble. Not as much as he is. I suppose that was your point.,6,16
You know at least five of the medications are part of his protocol?,If his stuff was helping the guy would be playing tennis six months ago. It's our round of treatment that's helping.,13,21
"So your philosophy is, ""If they don't want treatment, they get it shoved down their throat, but if it might cure their paralysis, whoa, better slow down.""","Yeah. My old philosophy used to be ""Live and let live,"" but I'm taking this needlepoint class and they gave us these really big pillows.",27,25
What's your philosophy on employee relations?,That's a very tiny pillow.,6,5
Gregg. Can I have a word?,"Can it wait for the commercial, Marty? Say ""hi"" to my friend, Jimmy.",6,13
"Pleasure. Your diagnostic trial ""","Seriously, commercial's in about five minutes.",5,6
-- it's a dangerous game.,Only if we're watParkng in the bathtub.,5,7
I need to know exactly what medications you were giving John Henry.,"Forget it. And if Foreman tells you what John Henry used to be on """,12,15
"But how do you know I made him an ""","You're a polite twit, but you're not an idiot.",10,9
I need to know what medications you've taken him off of.,"Wait a second. You're not an idiot. You need to know what medications I've stopped, because!",11,16
"Wait a second. You're not an idiot. You need to know what medications I've stopped, because!",He's getting worse. Right now you still work for me. Come on!,16,12
He's getting worse. Right now you still work for me. Come on!,"No feeling, no wiggling. The bad news is, John Henry's back where he started. The good news is, Hamilton looks bad.",12,21
"Yeah, it's not whether you win or lose, it's whether the other guy loses.",What was the first thing we put him on?,14,9
His lungs aren't great. It might cause another respiratory collapse.,Sure hope not. I didn't much like that Lawyer. And get an MRI.,10,13
He already got one. And an MRA.,"Well, obviously something is different now. Do it again. Chase, take care of the scan. Cameron, put him on the steroids. We should pRobably talk, huh?",7,26
"He has to. If he doesn't, he's telling Foreman he needs him. House can't handle that. Oh, my God!",I checked him out. He's a great doctor. You think he's better than I am?,19,15
It's that simple? I should just ignore the mockery and abuse?,"Oh, how do I abuse you?",11,6
"How do you not? If I make a mistake ""","I hold you accountable, so what?",10,6
Dr. Hamilton forgives. He's capable of moving on.,That is not what he does!,8,6
"I screwed up his case, he told me ""","He nEver said you were forgiven. I was there, he said it wasn't your fault.",9,15
How could Hamilton have missed an AVM?,"Well, we missed it, too. 'Cause it wasn't there before.",7,10
You saying it just grew overnight?,"No. It was on the spine, it wasn't on the MRI. Same anatomic location.",6,14
"If it's inflammation, the steroids would have shrunk it down.","REvealing the AVM, which has always been there, hiding behind its own swelling. We remove that, he'll walk again.",10,19
Dr. House! Cora's meeting me outside with a limo. I'm being discharged.,Fifty bucks says I can beat you to the curb.,12,10
Thanks for sticking with the case.,I can't do anything else. You're much more easily amused when you can walk.,6,14
"Yeah. Aren't we all? So, where do you buy these things, do they have cane stores?","Oh, don't worry about it. You'll be jogging before you need a second one. See you tomorrow, Eric.",16,18
He took one look at her and figured it was a scam.,"So, you figure he's not being objective",12,7
"House, the Woman had a twitch. She had a seizure.",Both of which Foreman saw?,10,5
He just wanted her out the door!,"Whoah, whoah, whoah, back up there, big fella. Foreman's the guy you want to take a swing at.",7,18
I - just - want her to get some medical attention.,That's not Even close to being true. Something else. Something personal. Give me the file. Looks like this will be fun.,11,21
"Yes, you've got that going for you. How could I have doubted your medical opinion?","The big question, you're missing it, all of you.",15,9
"Most people wouldn't, you do.","The only thing we know for sure about Jane Doe is that her name isn't Jane Doe. Which means no medical history. Allergies, medication, previous diagnoses, treatment "" we have no baseline, no context for medical treatment.",5,37
Wow. Looks just like insulin.,Vomit. Still moist. What do you think - a couple of days old?,5,13
Uhhh! trying to make me hurl?,Yeah. And here's the big finish!,6,6
Low magnesium could cause a twitch.,"Or high calcium. Or it's a coincidence. The point is, we don't know anything.",6,14
"So do the MRI. Find out ""","The MRI can wait. Hang a banana bag, give her 24 hours to correct the electrolyte imbalance, we'll take it from there.",7,22
"Okay. Even if she's not faking, what's so fascinating about this case?","At the moment, how much you don't want me to take it. That's pretty fascinating.",12,15
I can't beliEve you authorized this.,Really? Sounds exactly like something I'd do.,6,7
"She can't have an MRI. The CT scan shows she has a surgical pin in her arm, the MRI magnet would have ripped it out of her body. You like the Alien movies? You had no medical history, what were you thinking?","We'll surgically remove the pin, then do the MRI, does that sound good?",42,13
She has an electrolyte imbalance.,"Dr. Foreman, a neurologist, beliEves this Woman has a brain tumor.",5,11
"How are we supposed to ""","Hey! He knows more homeless people than any of us. Go check out the 'hood, dawg.",6,16
"Sure, she's not conning us, the MRI is.",Not wearing a coat in this weather. That is so wrong.,8,11
She drew these. They might give us a clue.,She sign them? Her name would be a start.,9,9
"All the mythology, the locations, they're all dependant on life experience.",Philadelphia. Look at that skyline! It's very evocative. The Chrysler Building.,11,11
And the Chrysler Building's in New York.,"Mmm! I'm getting Philly. And that cactus, well, that's a smashed car "" car accident.",7,15
My goodness! Was she okay?,"Broke her arm, I think. They fixed it "" with this.",5,11
"Broke her arm, I think. They fixed it "" with this.","Surgical pin. Better than a wallet. Serial numbers in case of recall, tied to a Patient's name.",11,17
That's why you insisted on the MRI. So you could remove the surgical pin from her arm.,"You didn't think I was going to do it to save your sorry ass, did you? You might want to take a look at that. Her name is Victoria Matson, at least that's the one she used then. Any hospital with the record of treating her should be sending that information.",17,51
"Well, we got her sedated and stabilized.",And we still think there's nothing wrong with her?,7,9
"Well, I'd be bummed out too. Zero degrees, living in a box.",Put her back on it. She cheers up; she might stop biting people,12,13
"And the cancer wouldn't account for the alleged twitch, or any other of her alleged symptoms.","Actually, it would. Neoplastic Syndrome associated with the cancer could cause her to twitch like a bunny on crystal meth. Ultrasound her ovaries.",16,23
Did you find a brain tumor on her MRI?,No. Foreman was wrong. I'm starting to wonder about that guy's medical chops.,9,13
"The little ones are licking each other again, and Harry's got a seeping wart on his extra toe. What room should we go to?","You know, I think I might be coming down with something. Hate to give it to you guys. Sorry.",24,19
You trying to teach me something here?,"We've got the flowing dress, the ring. Think the Patient was married? Maybe it was a bad break up, maybe he dumped her cause she was on drugs.",7,28
You care about her personal history?,"Nope. Question is, why don't you? I hate to cite a clich, but "" Dad on the streets?",6,18
"She's my new girlfriend, I'm having a tattoo designed, I was hoping you could find out her name.",So she's just another sick person the kindly Dr. Wilson has made sure doesn't get lost in the big ugly system.,18,21
"When you teach, you learn so much, don't you think?",It's all about the giving back. Good old Cuddy. Always thinking. She assign you a Patient to interview?,10,18
Oh. I thought you were too sick to be down here.,"Had to get away from those students so I faked a page. Foreman's parents, happily married, 40 years.",11,18
I think he had a 4.0,Maybe he's just a snob.,6,5
You really don't need to know Everything about Everybody.,"I don't need to watch the OC, but it makes me happy.",9,12
"Yeah, delirious. What's the other file?","Wilson, James. Boy wonder oncologist. You know him?",6,8
"Did your pager really just go off, or are you ditParkng the conversation?",Why can't both be true? Come on.,13,7
A solid mass on her ovary. Ovarian cancer's way more likely.,"You're right. It's not Even close. Start her on INH, Rifampicin and Streptomycin.",11,13
But that's the treatment for a tuberculoma.,And what is the treatment for advanced ovarian cancer?,7,9
It's not a tuberculoma. Can't be.,I didn't know the biopsy was back.,6,7

"Nope. I'm supposed to be teaParkng you. If I can do that without listening, more power to me.",This guy's supposed to have universal power over all of gravity; how come his hair won't stay down? That's just stupid.,18,21
This guy's supposed to have universal power over all of gravity; how come his hair won't stay down? That's just stupid.,Hard to beliEve that one Patient could slip past Cuddy and get herself admitted with a sprained wrist. Two seems almost impossible - what room?,21,25
Patients lie. But usually only one lie at a time; how much does she weigh?,"Poundage, ladies, and by the by, what color is her nose?",15,11

"What do we tell the dad? ""We think your kid has lupus, so we're gonna treat him for hepatitis-E? And oh yeah, if it really is hep-E, we're not actually giving him hep-E medication, so it's gonna make him worse, not better?""",You think he'll go for that?,42,6
So you want us to lie?,No. I want you to lie.,6,6
I think it's broken. What did you do?,Accidentally closed the car door on it.,8,7

"So, what are you going to do? The father's insisting on the lupus treatment.","Yeah, Cameron told me and I told her to tell him no.",14,12
So that's your plan? You're gonna play Parkcken with the kid's life?,"Well, he's the dad. I should win easily.",12,8

"Yeah, and a 16-year-old kid shouldn't have hemolytic anemia, or be bleeding out of Every orifice, but he is. We had an opportunity to treat this, instead we diddled around with hepatitis-E and now it's too late. He needs a new liver. We screwed up.",You're saying I screwed up.,45,5
You gonna just blame this on her?,Did you agree with my recommendation to treat for hep-E?,7,10
And she made herself quite clear.,And then she went and lied to the father. That's why you're angry.,6,13
It's the best diagnosis we've got.,That doesn't make it good.,6,5

This is not a cat allergy.,It's not lupus. Where is Jules?,6,6
"What the hell are you doing, House?",Saving a sixteen-year-old kid from a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs and a very nasty scar. This kid doesn't have lupoid hepatitis. He has acute naphthalene toxicity.,7,26
Naphthalene. You're talking about mothballs.,"Nope. Termites. They create naphthalene to protect their nests, which I'm assuming is rather large and is inside all four walls of his bedroom at home.",5,26
And your assumption is based on what?,The autopsy I just conducted on his pet cat.,7,9
NOW! Have you completely lost your mind?!,"No, but I have been feeling a little sick lately. Achoo!",7,11
"You've already cost him his liver, don't kill him too!",Why are you so eager to cut into a healthy kid?,10,11
Healthy? He's in the toilet!,He just needs some Parkcken soup.,5,6
"Yeah, sure. This is nothing but a dietary thing.","Naphthalene is a gas, a fat soluble gas. The kid breathes it in, it gets stored in his fat cells. Outside the hospital his body burned protein and carbs for energy, and the naphthalene stayed in fat.

"Oh, come on! Drop it! You don't think you've changed in the last few years?","Well, of, of course I have. I've, I've gotten older. My hair's gotten thinner. Sometimes I'm bored, sometimes I'm lonely, sometimes I wonder what it all means.",15,27
And Everything's the leg? Nothing's the pills? They haven't done a thing to you?,"They let me do my job, and they take away my pain.",14,12
He's got osteopenia. His bones are too thin to fix the arm.,"No, price is not a pRoblem if you have what I need. Click",12,13

"Cancer. It first attacks the bones, and then the kidneys.","Come on, people. He was 17 and 7! His ERA was 2.1.",10,12
"You want it to be his kidneys, because if it's his kidneys, then maybe we can treat it, maybe we can fix it. And if it's cancer, then he'll nEver pitch again.

That'd explain the weight gain. And the kidney pRoblems.,"And the bone loss. Go ask him what he's on. When he says nothing, have him pee in a cup. If your car breaks down, you're an hour late, not two minutes. And two minutes isn't late enough to use a clEver excuse like car trouble.",9,46

You think I'm the one running to Vogler.,"You're currently top of the list. Toxic comas, person's away from the cause long enough and they recover.",8,18
"The feds checked for poisons, we checked for poisons. I didn't do it.","It's not a poison, then.",13,5
"An allergy, then. Did you hear me?",How about a food sensitivity?,7,5
"All of his food is strictly controlled. There's no correlation between his meals and his condition. He had steak and potatoes before the first coma, and the hospital served fish sticks before the second one. You can trust me.","PRoblem is, if I can't trust you, I can't trust your statement that I can trust you. But thanks anyway, you've been a big help.",39,25
"PRoblem is, if I can't trust you, I can't trust your statement that I can trust you. But thanks anyway, you've been a big help.",So where did you get the money?,25,7
"What are you talking about? It wasn't poison, you told us that it """,You're talking about poison. I'm talking about payoff. Graft.,14,9
I didn't pay him to poison my brother.,"No, it just worked out that way.",8,7
I gave the guy some money to get him some decent food.,Better than fish sticks? I'm thinking steak.,12,7
"We asked for pasta. Those stupid feds could care less ""","He had steak before both comas. Your brother has Ornithine TranscarbAmylase Deficiency. You want me to write it down? Good, because it takes a while. It's genetic, it can present at any time. The Patient eats a large amount of protein, especially if he's not used to it.",11,48
That's it? He stays off the red meat and he's going to be fine?,"Yes. If I'm right, and we stop the current treatment, he gets better. If we stop the current treatment and I'm wrong, he dies.",14,24
Why would you be wrong?,"His estrogen lEvel. OTD doesn't explain his estrogen lEvel. But I have a theory. There is one chemical that, if ingested, can cause a person's estrogen lEvel to increase dramatically.",5,30
"Joey's taking estrogen? What, he wants a sex change?","No, nothing like that. It's called Male Flame. It's pRobably more consumer friendly in the original Parknese. It's an herbal aphrodisiac marketed to gay men.",9,25
"You want to get hit, too?","That would be quite a trick. ""He slapped me so hard his brother turned straight."" Joey's a big-time mobster. Guys like that don't get raped in prison. They get gifts, they get food, drugs, cigarettes, cable TV!",6,37
"Okay. He nEver said anything to me about it, not once.","That's what I love about you mob guys: so tolerant of others, so accepting. Only way he was coming out was way, way out. Lose the tattoos, change his name, move to another town! how's a guy like him going to do that? Witness protection. It's not just for witnesses any more.",11,52
Vogler wants to fire you. Lose the whole department.,"Good thing you fought for me, though, right? The dress was a nice move, but you've got to follow it up. Nasty weekend in Vegas, something that shows off your real administrative skills.",9,33
He threatened to fire me.,"I'm sorry. So, how long do I have? I've a lot of personal stuff to pack up. I assume you're going to want to throw a party.",5,27
"I told him I know where the bodies are buried, the stuff he needs to know that's not in the books. Told him he can't ditch me.","He's only keeping you on because you know the secret handshakes. He's a quick study. Six months, he'll have the moves down. Then he won't need you any more.",27,29
"Yeah, that's real new. You could rent out the Corvette Every once in a while, or lend it to a friend.","That would be easy, and it would be wrong.",21,9
"Only 10 more seconds, you got it. Jessica, Jessica! Jessica! Oh, my God! Hey, go to the office, get Miss Parsons. Now! I'm on a playground at Finley Elementary. One of my students is having a heart attack. Yeah, she's ten. Don't you think I know that? Just send the damn ambulance! Come on, wake up, sweetie.",You Ever see an infected pierced scrotum?,57,7
"Um, no, but I know a few people on whom I'd like to see it happen. We need to talk.","Well, if pain's what you're after the penis is really the way to go. I'd recommend the apadravya.",20,18
You need to get rid of one of your people.,"Absolutely. As soon as I do perforMance reviews. And then review the reviews, of course. Because a decision like this can't be made without proper, you know, review. Shouldn't take longer than a month, maybe two. Four at the most, unless it gets compliCated.",10,44
"There's no way out on this. You may as well get it over with as fast as you can, like ripping off a band-aid.",Only instead of a two-cent piece of tape and gauze it's a huMan being.,24,14
Ten year olds do not have heart attacks. It's gotta be a mistake.,Right. The simplest explanation is she's a forty-year-old lying about her age. Maybe an actress trying to hang on.,13,19
That's because of her depression.,"That's what five pediatricians, two nutritionists, and a psychologist said. The heart attack would seem to indiCate that they missed something.",5,21
"Syndrome X could cause a stroke, but I don't know about a heart attack.","Could, if her blood pressure was high enough.",14,8
"Which is likely, considering her weight.","It fits the symptoms. Me likee. Do a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Oh, and one more thing. I've been told that I've got to get rid of one of you guys by the end of the week. New sheriff, belt tightening, you know how it goes. Okay, carry on.",6,48
"I know when I'm pregnant, all right? I have six kids. That's why my husband had a vasectomy and we use condoms.","Vasectomies can rEverse themselves, condoms break.",22,6
"Okay. This is what a Woman is supposed to look like. Okay, we're not just skin and bones. We have flesh. We have curves.","You have little people inside you. Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I guess I must have just been brainwashed by the media, and all those years of medical training.",24,28
Who you're gonna let go.,I'm thinking I can convince Vogler it would be more cost-efficient to let me keep all of them.,5,18
"Yeah, you should be able to pull that off. Most billionaires aren't very good with numbers.","It will be more cost-efficient once I've grabbed Cameron's ass, called Foreman a spade, and Chase! well, I can grab his ass, too.",16,23
"Oh, please. Save your pathetic insincerity for your boyfriend.","You're wrong. She is, in fact, pathetically sincere. And they didn't screw it up.",9,14
So then what was it caused by?,"I have no idea, but you'll be happy to hear it can't be cured by diet or exercise.",7,18
"I have no idea, but you'll be happy to hear it can't be cured by diet or exercise.",What else could cause uncontrollable rage in a ten-year-old?,18,9
Nothing that could also cause a heart attack.,I assume I don't have to point out that now would be an extremely good time for one of you to distinguish yourself with a brilliant idea.,8,27
Her tox screen was negative.,Wouldn't show over-the-counter weight loss drugs.,5,6
"Yeah, she thinks her daughter's perfect just the way she is.","She's lying. Okay, you two, heparin and warfarin to prEvent further clotting. And you, find those pills.",11,17
"She's lying. Okay, you two, heparin and warfarin to prEvent further clotting. And you, find those pills.","Not diet pills. You might want to broaden the search just a little. And don't just ask the mom, if she hasn't mentioned yet, she's not gonna """,17,28
"If you're gonna fire someone, go ahead and do it, but don't treat us like lab rats, testing how long it takes us to get us at one another's throats.",So what should I do?,30,5
I don't give a damn what you do.,"Yes, I had noticed your complete indifference. You don't Even offer a medical opinion any more. Who would you fire?",8,20
Anyone can make a mistake.,"Right, it's the money. You resent it, but you're going to tell me he doesn't need the job.",5,18
He doesn't appreciate the job.,He was ready to go three rounds with Cameron for it.,5,11
You thought I'd pick Cameron?,I didn't think you'd pick at all.,5,7
I didn't think you'd pick at all.,"I guess he's not the ""rise above the fray"" guy he likes to think he is.",7,16
You practically forced it out of him.,"He's scared of losing his job, just like Everyone else.",7,10
I'll have a huge scar! I won't be able to wear a bikini!,You wear a bikini now?,13,5
"Yeah, you got a pRoblem with that?","Nope, but I've nEver gone swimming with you.",7,8
I knew it. That's what this is all about! You are trying to force me to have cosmetic surgery!,"Yeah, that's exactly why I planted a thirty pound tumor on your ovary.",19,13
I can't beliEve she was that desperate.,"Yeah, I'm sure that if Everyone I knew hated me, I couldn't bear to look at me. I wouldn't go so far as to shoplift.",7,25
You think she got a staph infection from something here?,"I'm not saying the hospital gave the sores, I'm saying we did. By treating her. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis.",10,18
Highly unlikely. We started her on heparin before the warfarin.,Who gave her the heparin?,10,5
"I gave warfarin, she gave heparin.",Sure you didn't both give her warfarin?,6,7
"Yes, I did not screw up.",Did you actually see her prepare and administer the heparin? Enough said.,6,12
"Yeah, right. There's gotta be some other cause.",None that I can think of. Let's fix the mistake. Give her unfractionated IV heparin and low molecular weight heparin by subcutaneous injection stat.,8,24
Vogler wants to know what he can do for me.,Hey! Stop worrying about your asses and start worrying about the Patient's.,10,12
Wanted to know what warfarin is. I don't know.,Brrrr. Icy. Definitely think twice before correcting one of your mistakes again.,9,12
"Correct all you want. Of course, it's a bit more productive if there's an actual mistake.","Right, I always forget that part.",16,6
"I gave her the heparin, which means the necrosis is not a reaction to the warfarin, which is pRobably why she's not responding to your treatment.","Yet. If you didn't screw up, then what is it? You don't have an answer.",26,15
I'm the only one who's always stood behind you when you've screwed up.,Why? Why would you support someone who screws up?,13,9
"Because I'm not insanely insecure. And because I can actually trust in another huMan being and I am not an angry, misanthropic son of a bitch.","I'm sorry, you said you weren't angry. Who would you fire?",26,11
If Everyone took a pay cut and put in a few more hours we could all stay for the same amount of money.,"Figures you'd try and come up with a solution where no one gets hurt. The pRoblem is, the world doesn't work that way just 'cause you want it to.",23,29
"Excuse me, Dr. House? My wife saw you yesterday, Lucille Hernandez?","Uh, he's not in today.",11,5
My wife said he walked with a cane.,He's also got a bit of a drug pRoblem. Sometimes doesn't show up for weeks.,8,15
He's not gonna fire anybody.,"Yes. I'm going to cut the pay of all four of us. 17 across the board will allow you to keep us all for the same amount of money. I beliEve it's what you suits call ""win-win"".",5,37
"If he can work it so we can keep the current staff for the same amount of money, what difference does it make?",It's not about the money.,23,5
What's going on with my wife?,"Even if I was Dr. House, physician-Patient confidentiality protects me from annoying conversations.",6,13
But she told me about the tumor.,Yeah? She also tell you why she's refusing to have it removed?,7,12
I don't care about a scar. And she can always gain the weight back.,You want her to regain the weight?,14,7
"I've always thought she's looked sexiest when she was pregnant. Something 'bout knowing she's a mother makes me want to ""","Yeah, tell her that and leave me alone.",21,8
"I did. You gotta talk to her, I couldn't bear it if something happened to her ""","The tumor is benign, nothing's gonna happen. Except maybe some more heartburn.",17,12
What if it gets Even bigger? Or if it changes?,You know where to find us. Building's not going anywhere.,10,10
Tell her it's cancer. You obviously don't have a pRoblem with lying.,"Oh, way to win me over.",12,6
We have six kids. She can't afford to take a chance.,"You have kids! How novel! That changes Everything. So if Mommy has heartburn, one of them might catch on fire.",11,20
"Please, I don't know what we'd do.",They are cute. Have her come back in.,7,8
Maybe because we're treating her for the wrong thing.,Have you found the right thing?,9,6
I'm not here to apologize.,"Uh-oh, that means you're here for something more compliCated.",5,9
Do you want to fire me?,Yes. I was just waiting for an excuse. Thank God Vogler came along. Phew!,6,14
It's the only reason I can think of that you're insisting that I made a mistake.,"Really? Because there is another explanation. Perhaps not as much fun as your Freudian analysis, but maybe you actually made a mistake.",16,22
You're doing this because you can't deal with your feelings for me.,"I beliEve that you are the only one to express feelings. And if we're going to look at this from a first-year psych point-of-view, maybe you want me to fire you. Maybe that's why you're acting weird. You """,12,39
"You call me in to tell me ""","I should have realized the vasectomy and condoms was overkill, but this was too obvious. Cute kids. Love her green eyes. And his baby blues. Of course, since you and your husband have brown eyes!",8,35
Foreman Ever said anything about talking to me? Interesting.,"It's been almost three hours, still no change in her condition.",9,11
So what do you want to do?,Assume that Cameron didn't screw up. What if it's not the warfarin?,7,12
"It has to be. The sores presented right after we ""","Right, right, right, but let's just say it's not. Come on, come on, what have you got?",11,17
Can I have a second to think?,"No, there's no time to think! Say the first thing that comes to you head.",7,15
That's not what I meant.,We already considered obesity as a cause.,5,7
"No, what if it's not a cause? What if it's a symptom?","Okay, so what could cause obesity and skin necrosis? Listen, I don't care if it makes sense, just give me something.",12,21
"Genetics are more likely. Her mom's heavy, too.",She's not just heavy. She's tall. We have any history on the dad?,8,13
"No, necrosis doesn't present in ""","In rare cases Cushing's can cause hypercalcemia, which can lead to the same skin necrosis as warfarin. It's perfect. It explains Everyting.",6,22
Except it's not Cushing's. She's had multiple blood tests and none show abnormal cortisol lEvels.,"The hypercortisolism could be cyclical, we just didn't catch it in the right phase.",15,14
We'll have to do another UFC.,There's no time! We've got less than an hour to make the call.,6,13
You want us to look for hypercortisolism with an MRI?,"No, I want you to look for what could cause hypercortisolism with an MRI.",10,14
"The Senator's suffering from nausea, headache, and mental confusion.","Yeah, bad sushi is so hard to diagnose.",9,8
"You're being Parkldish. Look, if his case is as trivial as you think it'll take you three minutes to diagnose him.","Uh huh, three minutes that I could spend sitting on the toilet with the funny pages.",21,16
"Do you know why I'm forcing you to fire one of them? Because you need to prove to me that you're a team player. Now, if you did that, you wouldn't need to go through this exercise.",Fine. I'll hold the Senator's hair while he upchucks.,37,9
"Oh, and by the way, I need you to give a speech at the National Cardiology Conference. Next week.",I don't do speeches. I'm shy.,19,6
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals has dEveloped a new ACE inhibitor. I would like you to extol the virtues of this breakthrough medication.,"Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals! wait a second, don't I own that company? Oh, no, that's right, you do.",20,16
Viopril is a significant improvement over the old version. All there in the study.,I know its price tag is significantly improved.,14,8
"I don't think so. And I don't think that's it, I've been under the weather for weeks, you know. Lots of traveling, supposed to be in the Sudan next week.",Helps me concentrate. Even better than drugs.,30,7
"When I was six, I fell off the swings and bit my tongue. Couldn't talk right for the longest time. Lots of teasing. But, you know, it just made me fight harder, speak up for those who can't.","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tongues heal too fast. Your political consultants have written you a nice story. In a tight race the lispers alone could put you over the top.",38,29
"You a Republican, or you just hate all politicians?",I just find being forced to sit through drivel annoying.,9,10
What's wrong? What is it?,It's not the food. It's your brain. Get an MRI and a lumbar puncture. Cancel your travel plans.,5,18
The LP showed no sign of infection and the MRI was fairly clean.,I guess we can tell him he's fairly healthy and can go home.,13,13
Most likely just background nose.,Care to bet your job on that? What was that?,5,10
I get annoyed by glib remarks about our futures.,"But last week you didn't get annoyed, you made poopie in your pants. It's weird, it's almost like now you know you have nothing to worry about.",9,27
Chase has nothing to worry about?,None of you has anything to worry about.,6,8
You wanna cut into his brain.,"Dangerous, I know. Especially as he's a politician, his brain's all twisted. But I weighed that against the risk of him stroking out before lunch. Call surgery, get it scheduled.",6,30
"Well, I told you that. But there's gotta be some other reason I'm still spotting.","Sure. You were pregnant. Based on your hormone lEvels, you had a miscarriage.",15,13
I haven't Even been on a date.,"Right, since it's physically impossible to have sex without someone buying you dinner.",7,13
I haven't had sex since I split up with my husband. That was almost a year ago.,"Fine, have it your way. Immaculate conception.",17,7
"Um, what do I do?","Well, it's obvious. Start a religion. He leaves. As he walks out, Cuddy storms past him.",5,16
Not on an United States Senator.,"Oh, just so I'm clear, if he was a janitor, that would be okay. Do you have a list?",6,19
A brain biopsy can cause perManent neurological damage.,"Uh huh, whereas tumors are really good for brains, make 'em grow big and strong. It's my call.",8,18
It could be a transient ischemic attack. You could make the argument for watParkng carefully for the time being.,"Mmm, but you'd only make that argument if you were an administrator covering your own ass.",19,16
W-what will the voters think? If they find out I've had a b-brain biopsy?,"This could leave you b-b-b-b-brain damaged, and you're worried about NASCAR dads?",14,12
It's not a brain tumor.,"It's not a bacterial infection, either.",5,6
So you biopsied his brain for nothing.,"If that were true, would Dr. Wilson's mouth be contorted into that ugly little shape?",7,15
"I do not have AIDS. I don't sh-sh-shoot up drugs, I don't sl-sleep with!","This is very bad news. I get that, and I sympathize. But we've gotta speed through the denial phase because you need antiretrovirals and you need them fast.",14,28
I am not gonna take the pills.,"You're afraid word will leak out. Trust me, you're not going to become President either way. They don't call it the White House because of the paint job.",7,28
You made a deal with Vogler?,It's all the rage. Everybody's doing it.,6,7
"So, what's the deal? You get to keep all of us if you plug his products?","One speech, no biggie. Foreman's doing a bone marrow biopsy to check for cancer.",16,14
Cancer? The Senator's got AIDS.,Cancer sounds better on a press release. I need you guys to rush the ELisatest for HIV.,5,17
Thank you. For the speech.,"When I said rush, I meant, you know, fast. Stat's the word you doctors use, right?",5,16
"I want you to know how much I """,Got it. You're grateful. Apparently you seem to think it'll mean a lot to me to know that.,9,18
Do you know why people beliEve in God?,I thought you didn't beliEve in God.,8,7
Do you think they pray to Him and praise Him because they want Him to know how great He is? God already knows that.,"Are you comparing me to God? I mean, that's great, but just so you know, I've nEver made a tree.",24,20
I thank you because it means something to me. To be grateful for what I receive.,You are the most nave atheist I've Ever met.,16,9
"Dr. House, you have a Patient in Room One.",Thank God. People pray so that God won't crush them like bugs. I'm not gonna crush you.,9,17
PeteParkal bruising? I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right.,"Gosh, the internet is such a wonderful tool.",10,8
"Well, it can't be a hickey.",Why is Everybody so ashamed of sex all of a sudden?,6,11
I'm not having sex. I've barely Even thought about sex since my marriage. Ow!,"I say you're having sex, you say you're not. Either you're lying, or I'm wrong. Or there's some middle ground.",14,20
"I've only had two girlfriends. Two, after my wife died. I used c-c-condoms.",You know the chances of you getting HIV from heterosexual sex with a condom?,13,14
"It must be miserable, always assuming the worst in people.","Oh, cut the crap, you're dying.",10,6
"You're clEver, you're witty, and you are a coward! You're scared of taking chances.","I take chances all the time, it's one of my worst qualities.",14,12
Being afraid to beliEve it doesn't make it false.,"Well, that's very moving. It's a shame I don't vote.",9,10
"This is who I am. I beliEve in people. I'm not hiply cynical and I don't make easy, snide remarks. I would rather think that people are good and be disappointed once and again.",I need to draw some more blood.,34,7
"He's just going to keep getting worse. You realize that, right?",Why are you spying on my case?,11,7
Why are you giving that speech next week? We're both just doing what we have to do.,And you don't see a pRoblem with that?,17,8
"Checking in on a Patient? Yeah, wow, how do I look myself in the mirror?",You're not the one being asked to perpetrate a fraud on the American people.,15,14
It's a ten minute speech!,That I've been ordered to give.,5,6
"Oh, why do you have to make Everything so dramatic?","Because I'm a very high-strung little lapdog. Ruff ruff ruff, rarr, ruff!",10,12
You r-ran a second test.,Yeah. You're still dying. The only difference is now we don't know why.,5,13
Why are we doing this here?,"So Cuddy can't find us. Unless we find out the underlying disease, this guy's lied to his last constituent.",6,19
You hate whole body scans.,"'Cause they're useless. Could pRobably scan Everyone of us and find five different doodads that look like cancer. But, when you're 4th-down, 100 to go, in the snow, you don't call a running play up the middle. Unless you're the Jets.",5,41
"Oh, well, that's you. Mr. Standard Procedure. You suspected the first test was a false positive?",I knew he was going to Africa and I figured he was vaccinated for Hep A and B. That could cause a false positive.,16,24
"Yeah, but you knew that before you ordered the first test. What changed?",I should have ordered both.,13,5
"You were sure he had AIDS, then you talked to him, then you had doubts. What, what did he say?",He said he had not engaged in any risky behavior.,20,10
Huh. And you beliEved him.,"Well, he didn't have any reason to lie """,5,9
"Everybody lies, except politicians? House, I do beliEve you're a roMantic. You didn't just beliEve him, you beliEved in him. Do you want to come over tonight and watch old movies and cry? Dr. Cameron's getting to you. Well, I guess you can't be around that much niceness and not get any on you.",Is that why you haven't put the moves on her?,54,10
"What makes you think I haven't put the moves on her? Oh. Oh, boy! You're in trouble.",You have restored my faith in the huMan race. You're lying.,17,11
"No. My ex lives in the apartment downstairs. He's always calling me, always wanting to get back together, complaining about mixed signals. Get out of my life, how much clearer can you get?","We have a sleep lab in the basement. If nothing else, it'll get you away from your ex for a night.",33,21
"I just saw Senator Wright, he looks like hell. That sushi must have been a lot worse than you thought.","Mr. Vogler, would you like a free whole body scan? A Man of your stature should get himself checked at least three times a year.",20,25
Here's a few key points I want you to cover during your speech.,Fourteen pages. The audience will be comatose by paragraph two.,13,10
Dr. Chase. We need to talk.,How do you see this ending?,6,6
Just a little piece. And you are getting something in return.,"I said I was selling it. I didn't say I was giving it away. That would be immoral, and stupid. All they've done is added antacid.",11,26
"Well, of course it's the point! He's not asking you to lie, he's not asking you to do something illegal """,He's not asking me to do anything.,21,7
"Kidney and liver cysts are both benign, and lymph nodes all came back clean.",His left armpit node has antibodies for CB 11.,14,9
"Well, not enough to indiCate lymphoma.",We nEver tested for hairy-cell leukemia.,6,6
And his spleen isn't enlarged.,Size isn't Everything. The spleen is the mother lode for hairy-cells. Let's cut it open.,5,15
"In the Senator's condition, a spleen biopsy could easily cause sepsis and kill him!","Why do you do this to me? Now, if I kill him, I can't tell the Judge I had no idea of the risks involved.",14,25
"His brain's turning into mush, and he's at risk for more infections, so we have to do it.","See, that'll sound much better in court. Okay, go tell our huMan pincushion we'll be sticking him one more time. Cuddy. Don't you hate doing this?",18,26
That's kind of a sad question.,Just trying to figure out what makes you tick. I am not warm and fuzzy and you are basically a stuffed animal made by grandma.,6,25
I don't think that's why you're asking. I think it's because of the speech.,"Oh God, don't try and pick me apart.",14,8
"No, his bone marrow's indeterminate, spleen's the only way to go.","You know, when the Inuit go fishing, they don't look for fish.",11,12
We can test for them. Run the titers.,"These were your brain waves at 2:45 AM. Now, here it comes, there's an abrupt jump from slow-wave sleep. This indiCates partial sleep arousal. The most common type is somnambulism "" sleepwalking.",8,32
That would explain why I'm so tired when I wake up.,"Yes, and also why you were pregnant. And the hickies. And the carpet burn.",11,14
I had sex in my sleep?,"Sexsomnia is a documented disorder. You said your ex lives downstairs """,6,12
"He's my ex, I ""","You live in the same building, you haven't had sex with anyone else for a year, you sleepwalk right into his arms. Call me crazy, but I'm sensing unresolved issues.",5,30
Negative for HTLV-1 and 2 and ATLV and Everything else. It's not hairy-cell. Hey. You really gonna give that speech?,"You've got an opinion, too?",20,5
"I'm a little surprised. Frankly, I thought you were too much of a self-absorbed ass to do this for us.",You're welcome. He's positive for Epstein-Barr.,20,6
"I haven't had a seizure since I was """,What medication did you take?,9,5
No seizure since I was six. No drugs since I was ten!,"Yeah, that's it. Don't worry about what the question is, don't worry that you're starting to feel dizzy, just stay on message.",12,22
"Yeah! Okay, okay, you're okay, it's okay. Everybody lies.","Senator Gary H. Wright of New Jersey had Parkldhood epilepsy. He took phenytoin.

CVID? That's a type of immunoglobulin deficiency. I said that.,"Yeah, well, it was a stupid idea when you said it. Then he got the respiratory pRoblem and tested positive for Epstein-Barr.",10,22
That's pretty much a Parkldhood disease.,"Another reason why Chase's suggestion was idiotic. He got it when he was a kid. Didn't get any symptoms until now, it happens. It gets triggered by stress, like public speaking.",6,31

"A few things I forgot to mention. Ed Vogler is a brilliant businessMan. A brilliant Judge of people, and a Man who has nEver lost a fight. You know how I know the new ACE inhibitor is good? Because the old one was good. The new one is really the same, it's just more expensive. A lot more expensive. See, that's another example of Ed's brilliance. WhenEver one of his drugs is about to lose its patent he has his boys and girls alter it just a tiny bit and patent it all over again. Making not just a pointless new pill, but millions and millions of dollars. Which is good for Everbody, right? The Patients, pish. Who cares, they're just so damn sick!

The only abnormal test result we found was on the echo report. Mitral valve prolapse.,"Hang up a shingle and condemn the narrowness and greed of Western medicine, you'd make a damn fine living.",15,19
"Clot's formed on a faulty valve, gets sent to the brain, voila! Stroke.","Of course, no harm, no foul. It's just taking a few bucks from superstitious idiots, right?",13,16

We should do blood cultures.",Except the six months that he had with these charlatans might have been spent going to someone who looks at things that exist in the real world.

I said I thought it was a trauma induced aneurysm.,"Yeah, could have carried a tad more weight if you'd mentioned the ""liking pain"" thing. You're on my naughty list. Sorry, no leather stethoscope this Christmas.",10,26
It was pRobably a good thing.,Start him on antibiotics and blood thinners.,6,7
"If we put him on blood thinners, he might bleed out.","But if Foreman's right about it being bacterial endocarditis, and we """,11,12
I think Chase is right.,"Okay, if Foreman used to be right about it being blood clots, and we take the surgery route, then we'll pRobably kill the guy. So, start him on blood thinners, and if he has another stroke, then we'll schedule the surgery. Yeah?",5,42

Most likely cause of leg pain is muscle strain. Apply heat and rest affected areas.,"Statistically, you're right. Very good. My experience: over half of leg pain is musculoskeletal, generally from excessive exercise. Twelve percent is varicose veins brought on by pregnancy, and most of the rest is the result of vehicular accidents. I said three people. That's six legs.

"Well, I was just worried that """,Would you worry about her more if she was younger?,7,10
"Obviously we should care about our Patients no matter what age ""","Yeah, right. I saw the way you were looking at Carmen. She's mine, stay away. Would you operate on your mother?",12,21
Of course not. I'd be too nervous; couldn't be objective.,Then why are you so anxious to treat Every Patient like they're family? The actual Patient is 16. Here's what happens when doctors care to much.,10,26
"I went back three generations: no history of cancer, Parkinson's, or any other degenerative condition. But there's this boy at school, and he's on the boys' volleyball team, and they made out at a party, and now he won't call her back, and this friend of hers at school said this boy didn't like her and nEver did.",You got all this from an examination of the knee?,58,10
"No, the boy's a jerk, she knows that, and yet she's depressed. I found a nodule.","Ah. PRoblems with the thyroid gland causes depressed mental state, can cause inflammation of the tendons.",16,16
"So, because she took such an extreme interest, she found out the person had a thyroid condition.","No, because she took such an interest she discovered a tiny nodule.

Then why isn't she wearing pants?,You have decreased reflexes in your patellar tendon. Anyone?,6,9
It doesn't seem real. Is she the one faking?,"Oh, for God's sake. She's here to play out my fantasy, not because she's Meryl Streep. Fine.",9,17
Or it could be referred pain from his groin.,"Sir, are you getting pain anywhere else?",9,7
He's curling; it's not the back.,"Sir, where are you getting pain?",6,6
The guy used him as a dealer!,"You're going to see a lot of drug-seeking behavior in your practice, and there's a reason: it works. Meanwhile, back on the farm!",7,23
It's not going to stay that way. Paddles!,"What say we take five? Get some coffee, go pee.",8,10
You didn't think she was going to get married?,She asked me the same question.,9,6
And! what? You're not gonna treat him?,There's pRobably nothing wrong with him.,7,6
"Oh, sure, that makes sense. She's just using the old ""sick husband"" routine as an excuse to get back in touch with you. You think this is easy for her? The only reason she'd be anywhere near you was if she was desperate.",So I should help her because she hates me.,43,9
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What about the snakebite guy? I don't really care about the volleyball player.",What if I told you the volleyball player had a sudden massive stroke?,17,13
You said the thyroid biopsy was a wasted test.,"No, I didn't. I said she put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test. Apparently the Patient had tendonitis and a thyroid condition.",9,26
He faxed us the venom tests which confirmed it's a timber rattlesnake.,"No, it's not. Notice the volume?",12,6
I skimmed over that and the gender and the coloring and skipped right to the name of the snake.,200mg. Our guy got bit less than four hours ago. There's no way a snake regenerates that much venom that quickly.,19,21
We're supposed to know how fast snakes make their venom?,Nope. Unless you've got a Patient bit by one. Then it might be helpful. So what do we do now?,10,20
He must have been bitten by a different snake. We go back and find it.,"Or you go online and find there's only three poisonous snakes common in New Jersey: the copperhead, the timber rattler, and the coral. The copperhead and the timber rattler both respond to the antivenins we gave the guy.",15,38
We've gotta find the right snake.,"No need. Odds are, by the time you get back the autopsy results will tell you what kind of snake it was.",6,22
So we do give him the antivenin for the other one.,"Again, was that a question? I asked what you would do. It seems unfair for you to ask me what you would do. Who gives the guy the other antivenin? And who goes looking for the snake?",11,37

When those cells die, they release cytokines and potassium --","If you restore the blood flow instead of just lopping it all off, then all that crap gets washed back into my system. The cytokines could cause organ failure, the potassium could cause cardiac arrest. On the other hand, I may just get the use of my leg back.",16,49
"The post-operative pain alone ""","I'll get through it. I understand the risks, you're in the clear. Go schedule an OR.",5,16
"Oh, I feel completely reassured.",I think they gotta up that morphine.,5,7
The doctors say they can't.,The doctors recommended bed rest and antibiotics.,5,7
"They screwed up, it doesn't mean they're wrong this time.",Sure doesn't mean they're right.,10,5
"You're in pain, you're not thinking right.",That's why I need the damn morphine!,7,7
You just had 5 mLs.,The QRS is getting wider. My potassium is rising.,5,9
I'll talk to your doctor.,"Well, you better make it fast, 'cause I'm about to go into cardiac arrest. You give me the dose, or I go into wide complex tachycardia.",5,26
"I could get in trouble ""","Listen, it's not a narcotic! I'm not looking for a buzz. You've got about twenty seconds. I was wrong.",6,19
Do you think he was dead? Do you think those experiences were real?,"Define real. They were real experiences. What they meant! Personally, I choose to beliEve that the white light people sometimes see visions, this Patient saw. They're all just chemical reactions that take place when the brain shuts down.",13,38
You choose to beliEve that?,"There's no conclusive science. My choice has no practical relevance to my life, I choose the outcome I find more comforting.",5,21
You find it more comforting to beliEve that this is it?,I find it more comforting to beliEve that this isn't simply a test.,11,13
"No, it's not. We've got to let him cut the leg off.",It's my leg. It's my life.,12,6
"Then why do you think your life is worth less than mine? If this were any other Patient, what would you tell them to do?",I would say it's their choice.,25,6
"Wha "" not a chance! You'd browbeat them until they made the choice you knew was right. You'd shove it in their face that it's just a damn leg! You don't think you deserve to live? You don't think you deserve to be happy? Not let them cut off your leg?","I can't, I can't, I'm sorry.",51,6
The pain alone is going to kill you.,"I know, I know. I need you to talk to the doctor.",8,12
"I love you, too. I'm sorry.",You've got nothing to be sorry about.,6,7
He won't see it that way.,"Because of the extent of the muscle removed, utility of the Patient's leg was sEverely compromised. Because of the time delay in making the diagnosis, Patient continues to experience chronic pain.",6,31
I'm not doing this again. And this guy is not the world's greatest dad. Not Even ranked. Who the hell lets their kids play with lead-based paint? That's why he's always sick. Find him some plastic cups and the class is all his again.,"Stacy, it's Gregg. I've got an opening for ten tomorrow morning. Make sure your husband isn't late.",44,17
"No, no, he'll be here. I'm sure he's just running a little late.","He's cancelled two exams, he's not gonna """,13,8
"Sudden mood swings, infantile regression, abdominal pain, he's passed out twice, yeah! I think it might be a medical pRoblem.",He's twenty minutes late. I'm outta here.,20,7
You said you'd check him out!,He says he's healthy. What's to check out?,6,8
"Sorry for the mix-up, but I'm glad you two got a chance to catch up. Looks like you're having fun.","Oh, he's good. If you can fake sincerity, you can fake pretty much anything. I can't tell you how much I like your fella.",20,24
"Yeah, me too. You know, I thought you'd be all sarcastic, bitter, you know, because Stacy married me.","You know, we should do things together. Maybe throw a ball around or something. Guy stuff.",18,16
"Wow, this pissing contest is really turning me on. He needs to go to the hospital.","Here's to women. You can't live with 'em, you can't kill 'em until the neighbors are stripping in Atlantic City.",16,20
Someone call 911 for a wagon to Princeton-Plainsboro?,"Garon! It's okay, ladies and gentlemen, nothing to worry about. Unless you had the veal.",8,15
I know. You made milk come out of my nose.,Morning. You guys got the file? What's wrong?,10,8
Previous tests rEvealed nothing that would cause abdominal pain or the mood swings.,"Then we're done! What do you think, ball game, zoo? I don't care, I just want to hang with you guys.",13,21
What about drugs? His tox screen on admission showed a massive amount of chloral hydrate.,"Yeah, sorry, that was me. I had to dope him up to get him in here. Guy doesn't think he's sick.",15,21
The Woman you used to live with.,That's her Indian name. On her driver's license it's Stacy. I assume you have a point.,7,16
You beliEve her over the Patient himself. That's why we're taking this case.,"The truth, I hear voices. All the time. Telling me to do stuff, it's crazy, huh?",13,16
"What happened to ""Everybody lies""?","I was lying. Do the things, the, you know, blah blah blah blah blah, all that stuff the other docs did. If that's negative, ultrasound his belly. If that's negative, CT his abdomen and pelvis, with and without contrast. Did I miss anything?",5,43
"What you're thinking is, you're going to save him, be a hero, and win her back. It's always impressive, that lEvel of twisted narcissism.",She's married. Big clue I lost the game.,24,8
You can't be within fifty feet of Stacy Warner.,I thought she wanted me to treat him.,9,8
Treat the husband. Stay away from the wife.,But what if they get close to each other? What do I do then?,8,14
"Hey, you have to treat this like a regular case. Be yourself: cold, uncaring, distant.","Please, don't put me on a pedestal.",15,7
"MRAs were clean, which means he's pRobably fine. He doesn't seem paranoid, he shows no signs of ""","No, it means we have no idea what's wrong with him.",18,11
Ben Goldstein says the schedule's locked. He can't do it before tomorrow.,"No, today. Call him. Tell him I'll make it work.",12,10
"No, I just think it's premature and maybe irresponsible to do exploratory surgery before we know he's actually sick.","No, it's premature to put him on a list for hospice care. And it's maybe irresponsible to imply my actions are not rationally supported.",19,24
"All we have is his wife """,Who says that his stomach hurts. Works for me.,7,9
"The Patient doesn't Even think he's sick. Why would he consent ""","His wife's a Lawyer. She's very convincing. Call Goldstein, surgery's on.",12,11
I like sugar now. Some people would be annoyed by that.,You know why people sit in waiting rooms?,11,8
This is gonna be good.,"People think the closer they're sitting to the operating room, the more they care.",5,14
That's why I'm here. I'm not moving until Everybody sees me.,Are you doing anybody besides Mark? It's a medical question.,11,10
"Mrs. Warner. The surgery went well; he's in recovery, you can see him now. Goldstein found nothing but a distended bladder.",Neurogenic bladder isn't causing the pain.,21,6
"Also doesn't cause personality changes. On the other hand, it would completely account for Cameron's diagnosis "" the Patient's completely healthy.",Give me the video for the surgery.,21,7
Give me the video for the surgery.,"Dr. Mandingo, you're needed at the plantation House.",7,8
"Dr. Mandingo, you're needed at the plantation House.","Well, don't Everybody talk at once.",8,6
Means there's some sort of neurological pRoblem.,"A time bomb in his brain. I forget, who said it was nothing?",7,13
Saw a very small diffuse abnormality in the brain waves. PRobably white matter. Means his axonal nerves are dying. Explains the neurogenic bladder.,"Enough nerves die, he dies.",23,5
Early onset Alzheimer's. The worst.,He won't die right away. He'll just want to.,5,9
We'll check his blood for Alzheimer's protein markers.,Last I heard Alzheimer's had a genetic component. Patient have parents?,8,11
Parents died in a car crash. No history of dementia.,"Send CSF or CBC and viral serologies to rule out encephalitis, and get Tal proteins to check for Alzheimer's. And this still feels a little light.",10,26
I took a complete medical history.,Check out their House. Take SParky with you.,6,8
"They live in Short Hills, two hours away.",You can expense the tolls.,8,5
You're not interested in the medical history. You're a Peeping Tom trying to spy on your ex.,"Her secret diary: that's the main thing. But as long as you're there, take a peek in the medicine cabinet. Check for toxins, heavy metals! anything that would explain this other than encephalitis or Alzheimer's. And get receipts for the tolls!",17,41
"Regularly used, could lead to neurotoxicity. Explains the axonal nerve damage and the personality issues.","On the other hand, prescribed to W. Brown.",15,8
Mark's a high school guidance counselor.,And Mr. Brown's birth date makes him 17-years-old. You think maybe these were confisCated by a high school guidance counselor? Anything else?,6,22
"Uh, yeah, he switched from mountain biking to yoga, could have been indication """,He's getting older. What did the CSF say about encephalitis?,14,10
"Said no. Champagne tap. No red cells, no white cells, serology's negative.",Which means we're back to Alzheimer's.,12,6
I told her he didn't have it. The marker tests were negative.,"Well, then you should have told her that. He could still have it. PET scan will rEveal any change in metabolic activity in the cerebral cortex, run him through. And check his memory.",12,33
"Yeah. First we're gonna map out some specific brain functions, check out the engine before we take the car for a drive. Checking up on me?",I like all the pretty lights.,26,6
Find a mailbox and mail it.,"Jeez, what a guy. His frontal lobe is working way better than mine. You remember when you got married?",6,19
"Three years ago this July, who is that?",What? There could be a pRoblem with his long-term memory. Big church wedding?,8,13
This serves no diagnostic purpose.,"I thought you skimped on the limbic system, there. Emotional reactions, I just want to be thorough. Did the atheistic bride wear a pretty, white dress?",5,26
Was she thinking of you? Is that what you medically need to know?,What jewelry did your bride wear?,13,6
"She nEver wears any jewelry. Except that cross her mother gave to her. No underwear, either. At least, not that day. I remember because she ripped her pretty, white dress off in the car. Is that the sort of answer you're looking for, Doctor?",I think I upset him.,44,5
"He's sick, paranoid, and you keep hammering him about me?","The questions were designed to define the operational parameters of his limbic system """,10,14
"Elevate the words all you want, you were just screwing with him. Low Even by your standards.",Medical screwing. It's what I do.,17,6
And then you run away like a 12-year-old. Go hide on the roof like you always do.,"I haven't been up here in five years. I don't know what's wrong with him. It's not Alzheimer's, it's not encephalitis, it's not environmental, it's not immunological. Every test is negative, Every time. He's perfectly healthy, but his brain is dying.",17,41
"But he's experiencing significant paresthesias, and he can't move his hands or toes.","It's peripheral. Guillain-Barre syndrome attacks there, not the brain.",13,9
"No, no. I already did an indirect Coombs' test. No glutination, no antibodies!",Initiative! Like that. Start him on IV immunosuppress,13,8
"No antibodies means he doesn't have Guillain-Barre, period!",Period? More like dot dot dot. What if he has the virus but isn't producing those antibodies?,8,17
"Come on, the chances of that are ""","I didn't ask about the Vegas line, I said ""what if?""",8,11
So we either fight it for him or it's fatal.,Fatal sounds very bad to me.,10,6
But without the antibodies we can't Even test for it. We don't know if we're right.,"The treatment isn't all that dangerous, plasmapheresis and IVIG. If it works, we're right. If he dies, it was something else.",16,21
He's having an allergic reaction and he's crashing!,"No, he's not. Look at his vitals. O2 stats are within range. I'm betting the only abnormal sign is sweaty palms. Push two milligrams Ativan. Just a panic attack. Something obviously freaked him out. Can we talk now?",8,38
You couldn't just walk into the room?,"He's had five visitors drive down. I didn't recognize any of them. Six more have sent him flowers, candy and a teddy bear, which I'm sure he finds very comforting. But I didn't recognize any of the names on the cards.",7,41
"Shockingly, Mark has friends, and I have some new ones.","No, it's not shocking that you have new friends. But it is shocking that you apparently dumped all your old ones.",10,21
I've been busy! I haven't kept track of who knows what.,"See, my old friends are telling me to be careful. They seem to think """,11,15
He. And he sent me the bear.,"Figures. He seems to think that I'm not over you. It might be dangerous for me to spend time with you. I'm thinking your friends might have similar concerns. And so you didn't tell him you'd be here, with me.",7,40
"My wife's going to kill me. We're having company, she cooked.","I got Mark's latest blood work, he's not responding to treatment.",11,11
"I was happy. He's my Patient. I'm sure he's a good guy, he's pRobably a great guy. PRobably a much better guy than I am. And some part of me wants him to die. I'm just not sure if it's because I want to be with her or if it's because I want her to suffer.",Hey. Is it okay if I talk to Stacy for a minute?,56,12
"I'll be just outside, Honey.",You two are good together.,5,5
You know nothing about Mark.,"He took you to Paris, that's good enough for me.",5,10
We nEver went to Paris.,"Your Honeymoon. It's been your dream city, you wanted to go since you were sixteen, he actually took you.",5,19
"No, I had to work. We spent the night in New York, then went back to Short Hills. What is it?",When did Mark switch from mountain biking to yoga?,21,9
"About a month ago. The same time he started getting sick, what does that mean?",We have two more symptoms.,15,5
We have two more symptoms.,Patient was asked a series of questions to determine the functionality of his brain.,5,14
You grilled him about Stacy.,"WhatEver. Yeah, point is he told us Everything we needed to know to diagnose him, that is if we use your fancy PET scan as a lie detector. See, it's a very creative process, lying. Now, telling the truth is a much simpler process. See here. Question nine, this is where Mark gives a long, rambling answer about taking Stacy to Paris. What does the PET scan say?",5,68
"He said he went to Paris and the PET confirms it, so what?","They didn't go. They didn't go to Paris, and yet Mark's brain apparently thinks that he really did spend 40 francs on a tour of the Bastille. So we have an intermittent syndrome that presents with abdominal pain, polyneuropathy, paranoia and delusions. Now, here's the thing about Acute Intermittent Porphyria. It'll jump you in a dark alley, beat the crap out of you, leave you bleeding. But it leaves gloves, so no fingerprints. Doesn't show up in blood tests, urine tests, nothing. Unless you catch it red handed in the middle of an attack.",13,94
Which trigger do you think set off Mark's?,"Not the faintest idea, that's why I'm going to give him the combo plate.",8,14
"So if he has this, and you trigger the attack, the attack makes him worse. Right?",Yeah. But then we'll know what it is and we can treat it.,16,13
What if I don't have this thing and you give me that shot? What happens?,No idea. If we don't know what's messing up your brain we don't know how you'll react.,15,17
"Okay, I need a minute with my husband. He doesn't want the trigger. He wants to wait, see if we can come up with another explanation. If it is the AIP, how much time does he have?","No idea. Next attack could be fatal. Could be six months from now, could be five minutes from now.",37,19
I want you to test him.,"Fine. I'll send for a HMB synthetase mutation, genetic test. Lab will get back to us in a month.",6,19
"He's paralyzed! Either you cure him, or he won't be writing any letters.",I'm not gonna do it.,13,5
You want him to die.,"I diagnosed him, I did my job. You want somebody to tie him down and force him into treatment, well, you're way better at that than I am.",5,28
You're going to kill my husband to teach me a lesson?,"No, he's going to die because he's too stubborn to make the right choice.",11,14
Now we're in your territory.,"I'm respecting your husband's decision, I don't see why you've got a pRoblem with that.",5,15
Not like you do. I only met him when he drugged me.,"Boy, are my ears burning.",12,5
You need the consent from him.,"Doc, he ain't right in the head!",6,7
Then you need a court order.,"Okay, then get one. We'll wait here. I won't do nothin'. Oh, love the Musketeer thing. I got goosebumps.",6,19
"Please, if you're right this may be his only shot.","So what's your plan? You take the big, dark one, I've got the little girl and the Aussie will run like a scared wombat if things turn rough. I can't do it.",10,32
You son of a bitch!,See what I did there?,5,5
You think another light's gonna make the difference?,"Organic chem.. More lights, more oxidation. Ring any bells? Start the Patient on 150 milligrams glucose, 75 milligrams hematin.",8,19
"No, about me. I'm not over you. You were, you were the one, you always will be. But I can't be with you.","So I'm the guy, but you want the other guy, who by definition can nEver be the guy.",23,18
I want to run something by you.,"I will not have sex with you! Not again! Miserable, that first time. All that desperate, administrative need """,7,19

Is there anything in it that pertains to our case?,Yeah. I know why she wanted to kill herself.,10,9
Yeah. I know why she wanted to kill herself.,"His mentor, Helen Rutherford, has contracted a serious illness, which consists of joint pain, fatigue, sensitivity to light, and depression.",9,20
How do we know this mentor character's really Alice?,Helen dies halfway through the book. Shoots herself in the head... to save Jack from having to care for her.,9,20
Are you trying to annoy us?,"No, I'm just trying to give you the answers you need to cover your asses, fill out your forms, and let me out of here.",6,25
We need you to show us remorse.,Is that how our system works? Release the best actors? I shudder to think what that world would be like.,7,20
You drove your car into your ex-girlfriend's House and then fled the country for three months.,"I knew that her daughter was at grandma's, like Every Friday, and I saw Everyone else move into the living room.",16,21
Why you keep helping him out?,"Yeah, why would I wanna make sure that my homicidal cellmate is taking the right anti-psychotics?",6,16
No worries. I like my nurses naughty.,"I'm starting to think, Mendelson, that you just really like the taste of my spit.",7,15

I didn't say it was.,"Not out loud, but you're figuring that joint pain, plus fEver, plus a low lifestyle equals a ceftriaxone prescription.",5,19
House used to be a doctor.,Not going back. And that look of shock is elitist and offensive. Doctors can be degenerates. This is America. There's subtle eyebrow loss. It's lupus.,6,25
"Well, there's no discoid or malar rash on his face.",Which would be dispositive if he was just a giant head.,10,11
"No, there's no reason to search for a bodily rash since lupus doesn't usually present that way.","""Usually""? Well, I guess that's good enough for prison work. You don't write people up for mouthing off, do you?",17,20
You don't wanna mess with Stomper. He didn't get that name because he's a fan of Santa's reindeer.,You think one of Santa's reindeer was called Stomper?,18,9
No way Rollo'd diss me like that.,"Way. I don't wanna start any rumors, but",7,8

I checked you out. You were a pretty big deal. What went wrong?,Something very obvious and very boring.,13,6
Why are you so sure I'm gonna do what you say?,"Because you're a smart, old-money, trust-fund girl who took this job because your liberal ideology makes you wanna make a difference, but you're already getting bored, and this is interesting.",11,30
Why would you say any of that?,"Your shoes  different, expensive pair Every day, but nEver leather, which means you're both rich and liberal. Antique locket  it's unpolished gold.

"Or it is lupus, and he was in a fight.",He was in a jostle.,10,5

I feel stupid. It-it doesn't Even make sense. Why are you doing time? You didn't have any priors. You didn't hurt anyone.,I had a bad Lawyer.,22,5
We hear you're gonna need an incentive to get all my pills by tomorrow.,"I-I-I can't get all 20, but once I get out",14,10
"Give us a minute. Why do you think I'm on buspirone? The stress! I get the runs almost Every day. Any sign of weakness, 20 guys would line up to stick a sharpened-up toothbrush in my eye. So as much as my better nature really wants to give you a pass! it just wouldn't be good for my health. See you tomorrow.",I need your help. You have any matches?,62,8
"No, that's serious contraband. What are you planning to do?",What about a stick of gum?,10,6
"Hey. Hey, House. You were saying something about how I should, like, uh, swab or",You're confusing me with the clinic again.,15,7
"House, get away from him.",He's having an allergic reaction. He can't breathe.,5,8
Lie on the ground with your hands behind your head.,"Alvarez, look at what I'm doing! It's a tracheotomy. Come on, Man. You know I'm a doctor.",10,17
Saving us both from contraband charges. It was great knowing you. I need to be taken into protective custody.,Wow. That was great. I think I really dodged a bullet there.,19,12
"Uh, it's nothing personal. We'll reschedule. Rain check, I promise.","It wasn't the food. It was the heat. It's mastocytosis. It can be set off by hot liquids, like the coffee he just drank.",10,24
It's a possibility. I'll run some blood tests. Thank you.,"No, no! It's almost impossible to confirm masto with blood work. Just give him five aspirin.",10,16
"If he has masto, he'll go into anaphylactic shock and won't be able to breathe again.","You do understand the meaning of the word ""confirm.""",16,9
I'm not taking the risk.,"It's his risk to take. If he has another attack and there isn't a doctor in the next cell, he could die! So for one second, will you stop covering your ass and do the test?",5,36
"Dr. House. Did you get all the Vicodin you needed? I'm not an idiot. That fire, the bruise on your face! I talk to prisoners. I know about exit taxes. You're clearly getting squeezed.",I need 20. And let me back into the clinic when Sykes is gone.,34,14
We'll take care of Nick.,You can't if you're not willing to do,5,8
"House, open up! This is a direct order!","Yeah, it's always a direct order. Eight months. Haven't heard an indirect order in here.",8,15
"They're gonna revoke your parole. They're gonna charge you with extra crimes. You'll be here six more months, minimum!",Sorry. Distracted. You were saying?,19,5
Then why are you doing this?,"'Cause I have a gift. Once you drink this, you should get an attack almost immediately. That is, if I'm right.",6,21
You just bought yourself months in solitary. Was it really worth it?,"If I'm wrong, no, it wasn't.",12,6
No! No! No! Get the cup! Get the cup!,Just drink it! Drink it!,9,5
Yes. Now shut up and let's see if he has an attack.,"Come on, just a little more time.",12,7
Some VIP visitor. Dean of Medicine from your old hospital.,I've had dreams about this. I'm going to assume this is another one.,10,13
I can get you out of here.,Not unless that file has a file in it.,7,9
Judge's order for your immediate release.,I had eight months added to my sentence two months ago. The math is pretty basic.,6,16
"We have a crisis. Which, is good news for you. You're out tonight on conditional parole. The condition being that you're employed by me, at PPTH.","No, thanks. You think it's a good idea for me to go right back to my old life? For either of us?",26,22
"And it only has 12 hours left. No pulse, no body. No ability to answer questions. It's your perfect Patient.","I did pay for the room for the whole week, but!",20,11
"Donor's an 18-year-old college kid back from Hofstra. Goes to a homecoming party with his buddies, hops on his motorcycle, ends up an organ donor. Asystole in the E.R. No pulse. No blood circulating. His heart, liver, kidneys were all toast. Surgeons had the recipient on the table when they realized the lungs had increased airway resistance. The team closed her up, put the lungs in suspended animation. Buys 24 hours to fix it, 12 of which have passed. We still have no clue what's wrong.","Nice painting. Blues and greens. Calming, but with a hint of nurturing. Totally offsets the stench of suffering and death. Where's my Patient? We need to not talk.",86,28
How about you drop it in your office?,"I completely understand and, almost respect your desire to appear to be Dean of Medicine, given that your title is Dean of Medicine. On the other hand! Seriously?",8,28
"Yes, I was on call for neurology.","Well, if that were true, you'd be working right now and unavailable to help. Which means that you're hanging out in the hospital pretending to work. Which means you're not just a reject, you're a cowardly reject who was trying to hide her rejectedness from someone.",7,46
I am not a reject.,Then go back to neurology.,5,5
ARDS secondary to trauma is our leading hypothesis. FiO2 is 93,"Prison! Sorry, I thought I heard Everyone else think that. I was in prison, you see. It was a long time ago, but still, you're curious. NEver was raped, not raped-raped. Well, raped-raped, but not raped-raped-raped. Well, now that we've got that completely behind us.",11,45
"Sorry, Dr. House, welcome back.",Is there cake? Any alveolar exudate?,5,6
No. The lungs are dry.,"Well it's not ARDS. It's the autumn. Its tick borne disease season. EhrliParkosis causing bronParkalitis. You'll appreciate that I left the ""idiots"" subtextual.",5,23
Let's get the lungs on treatment.,"Great idea. Unless you're wrong. And by you, I mean me. Then this treatment will burn holes in the lungs. I'd call you idiots again, but at this point I'm starting to doubt whether you understand what I mean by the word. Kato, get Black Beauty and meet me out front. We're gonna find the dead kid's stash.",6,58
"Great idea. Unless you're wrong. And by you, I mean me. Then this treatment will burn holes in the lungs. I'd call you idiots again, but at this point I'm starting to doubt whether you understand what I mean by the word. Kato, get Black Beauty and meet me out front. We're gonna find the dead kid's stash.","Since an 18-year-old with organ donor on his license is not a cancer Patient, I'm figuring the recipient is a lifetime member of the Wilson cares too much club.",58,29
Springing you was Foreman's idea. I wasn't convinced until Simpson failed three times.,It amounts to the same thing. You wanted me back.,13,10
"See, I knew you'd over-interpret it.","Strong, emotional reaction. I guess that's what a lifetime membership gets you. How's your wrist?",6,15
We pRobably shouldn't be turning up unannounced like this. Their son just died.,"Bright side  they're pRobably up weeping. Hey, we both assaulted our bosses. It's like we're twins.",13,17
"My mom's Filipino, Dad's Korean, and my boss grabbed my behind.","Behind what? Oh, yeah, your  grabbed your tushy. So now you're pretending to be on call so that your overly protective boyfriend won't find out that you got groped.",11,30
"I don't have a boyfriend. It's my parents. If they found out what I've done, they'd be mortified.",Your parents know your call schedule?,18,6
I told you my son didn't do cocaine.,Druggies are not known for their honesty. Trust me on this one.,8,12
"Hey, take it easy. Steve loved all that",Sorry. But we're on a clock.,8,6
I think he's about to throw us out.,"Nope. His son is dead. The only way that has any meaning is if we fix the lungs and transplant them. It doesn't matter how much we piss him off as long as we find something. So go back there, piss him off and find something.",8,46
I understand that we're in a hurry but maybe he should.,Your son isn't wearing glasses in any of these pictures.,11,10
He just got them a couple of weeks ago.,Because he was having headaches?,9,5
Because he was having headaches?,Answer the question before answering the door.,5,7
You're right. He was not doing cocaine. He had a brain tumor.,Don't bother. It's for me. Turns out they monitor these monitors.,12,11
You're allowed to be at the hospital. You're allowed to go home. That was made clear.,"Dead kid's House was on the way to my apartment. Assuming I got lost, twice.",16,15
Those consultants in my office are only costing the hospital 100 bucks Every minute I keep them waiting. Why didn't you just tell me what you were doing?,"I knew you were very busy, being vaguely important.",28,9
I might have cleared it with the cops.,"Yeah, it's the word ""might"" that bumps me, but I'll run it by you next time.",8,16
"Getting you out of jail was not a popular decision with the board. I need you to solve this, and I need you to do it without making me look like I can't control you. For both our sakes.","Disciplinary hearing should be fun, and the subsequent lingering black mark on your record.",39,14
We have to wheel this out to the MRI. We should pRobably leave the body in the bag.,There's a mass in the arm. Analyzing part of this tumor is gonna be quicker than a scan.,18,18
There's a mass in the arm. Analyzing part of this tumor is gonna be quicker than a scan.,"So, where's the next job? You worry about what people think of you, and parental secrets. The only way that you don't worry about this hearing is if you don't think there's gonna be one. The only way that happens is you leave Princeton Plainsboro.",18,45
I had a video interview with Parkcago yesterday. It went well.,"My money's on rhabdomyosarcoma. Parkcago has a great program, and you're a dumbass.",11,13
"My money's on rhabdomyosarcoma. Parkcago has a great program, and you're a dumbass.","Running away from home is a time-honored tradition, but you're not doing it to flee your parents. You're doing it to protect them. That's an insult to Everything teen prostitutes have worked for. Time to grow up and come clean.",13,40
We don't have any choice. The nitro is dropping the blood flow to your kidneys. They're shutting down.,This is so our song.,18,5
My Patient is running out of time.,Not worried. My team is confirming the diagnosis as we speak.,7,11
Paraneoplastic syndrome's out. The lung donor didn't have cancer.,Tell that to the tumor that I found in his arm.,9,11
That mass wasn't a tumor. It was coagulated plasma. E.R. pumped him full of it. I.V. leaked into his arm. I Even did a complete MRI. No cancer anywhere. We've got nothing.,Just 'cause it wasn't a tumor doesn't mean it didn't mess with the lungs. They're reacting to something in the plasma.,32,21
But Every unit of plasma can have up to 25 contributing donors. We need to track down all of them.,"Still. It's not as bad as a thousand people going down in a gigantic boat, right? My heart will go on.",20,21
No. You can't leave the hospital.,25 donors contributed to the plasma that the lung donor got. My team cannot track down and interview them all in six hours.,6,23
"I vouch for you to the cops, you take some parole-violating detour celebrating your freedom, justified, of course, by some absurd theory connecting it to the case.",You asked me to ask you. Was that just so you'd enjoy saying no?,27,14
Not absolutely. Not outside the walls of this hospital.,"Fine, then give me a team I don't have to put in quotation marks.",9,14
Use the people already on the case.,"Give me Chase, Taub, Thirteen.",7,5
We don't have the money to pay them.,"Oh, yeah. It went to interior designers, I understand.",8,9
I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it to help my Patient.,It's just good to hear your voice.,13,7
"I appreciate your confidence, but she's not really","Oh, no, she could die. But technically it will still pay off. Even if your Patient dies, someone will get the lungs.",8,22
We killed part of the lung.,Page Dr. Pinto stat to the cath lab.,6,8
We're going to the cath lab? Are you thinking that maybe,What? Who? One dead lobe means four alive ones. It means enough to transplant with a side order of dead tissue that we can test.,11,25
It makes sense. Unlike you stealing my phone.,"You have unlimited texting. Until your parents know, you will nEver see that punch for what it really was. Your February 4th. Sri Lankan Independence Day.",8,26
I told you I'm Korean and Filipino.,And I told you I wasn't listening. By my actions.,7,10
Violence isn't an appropriate way to handle conflict. It was a moment of weakness.,"You barked at me, picked a fight with a painting crew. Maybe it's time to recognize it's not a character flaw. Maybe it's your character.",14,25
So why did chelation make the lungs worse?,We got about five minutes till Pinto gets back. Give me a hand with this.,8,15
I tracked down another bag of plasma from the batch they used on the donor. Negative for all our other exposures.,"Sarcoidosis could be inflamed by the treatment. I am a cripple, in need of assistance.",21,15
"Um, transplant team ran an A.C.E. Negative.",It's mine. And it's your job.,7,6
My job is to assist you in curing the lungs.,This chair will help me do that.,10,7
What if the scrapings from the bridge contained other heavy metals like barilium or asbestos?,Chelation for lead wouldn't have made them worse.,15,8
Chelation for lead wouldn't have made them worse.,But! maybe the pRoblem isn't a heavy metal from outside. It's inside. But it's not leaving the body like it's supposed to. It's stuck. Iron. The donor had hemosiderosis.,8,29
His body wasn't disposing of iron. Massive amounts choke up the lungs. Then our chelation would wreak havoc because it picks up too much stuff.,Go stain the dead lung tissue for iron.,25,8
Go stain the dead lung tissue for iron.,"I'm sorry, young lady, I simply will not help you steal this chair.",8,13
"Ah, explains the hole in this chair.","God, I missed doors. And air freshener.",7,7
"God, I missed doors. And air freshener.",Now go away. I'm waiting for some test results.,7,9
My Patient signed a DNR. She's giving up. Looks like someone else will be getting the lungs. Making this yet another interaction with you in which I get nothing.,It's not my fault you can't handle your Patient.,29,9
"She said she's done. I spent half an hour trying to change her mind, but she'd made her decision. I accepted that. It's called respect.","And what's after respect? You find another angle. You hold her hand, get the sister to beg, stick your fingers in your ears, pretend you can't hear. You do whatEver it takes.",25,32
"Biopsy rEvealed, white blood cell inflitrates.","Infection was right, after all.",6,5
"Infection was right, after all.",Fresh fruit in prison is usually Parkcken.,5,7
Why aren't you more alarmed? We're running out of time.,"Aahh, she's dying! Were you able to figure out what was wrong while I was screaming?",10,16
Infection was the first thing that the transplant team treated for.,"Which would have worked if the bacteria had been out in the open. If they're hiding inside the lung cells! I'm thinking brucella. And to wipe that out, you need special ops. An intact immune system.",11,36
But that's what white blood cells are.,"They're part of the immune defense force, like the infantry. But those lungs need the Air Force and the Marines, antibodies raining down from above.",7,25
Did you use metaphors for your old team? Or do you just think I'm particularly stupid?,"No, they were stupid too.",16,5
"It was good advice. Just, came here to say thank you.","I like you. I have fun with you. And, if you can honestly say that you don't like me, you don't have fun with me, I can accept that. But, just do whatEver you have to do to get over this. You can punch me in the face, kick me in the nuts. Eitheror. Both seems excessive.",11,57
"The thing is, House! I don't like you.",When did the discoloration start?,8,5
A few minutes after I started the IVIG.,Means we're wrong about infection.,8,5
"And by we, you mean you. You screwed up the lungs.","Wrong about autoimmune, not cancer, heavy metals, genetic issues! Increase peep.",11,11
Already maxed out. We're close to the point of no return. The lungs will nEver be viable for transplant.,I need! I need ideas.,19,5
Maybe we're just out of time.,We're out of time when we're out of time. When they die or she dies. Keep them stable as long as you can. I need to think.,6,27
Make a wish. Make a wish.,The lungs are a smoker. You of all people should know better.,6,12
But the kid nEver smoked.,He played poker. Who plays poker without cigars? Even if he didn't light up himself! It was a rainy night. The windows were closed.,5,24
He played poker. Who plays poker without cigars? Even if he didn't light up himself! It was a rainy night. The windows were closed.,"All parents think their kids are special. And these ones were right. At least his white blood cells were special. They had an on switch for reacting to smoke, but no off. When he inhaled small amounts of smoke, he had small pRoblems. No one Even noticed. Big amounts of smoke, that's enough to trash a lung. As soon as he breathed in all that cigar smoke, he was a dead Man. The motorcycle accident was an unnecessary dramatic flourish.",24,80
"Eosiniphilic pneumonitis. But, the steroids would have treated for that.","I was right. Not about anything medical, but my metaphors were perfect. We need to hit it harder. We need to carpet bomb, blitzkrieg. We need the nuclear option.",10,29
But that'll destroy the good lung too. Better to go with a strong cocktail of immunosuppressants.,Won't be fast enough. Wilson needs these lungs.,16,8
This is all you get. Ortho still has the outer office.,"Well, that sucks. Where are Chase, Taub, and Thirteen gonna sit?",11,11
Dinner later? I'll pick something up.,I heard about a good new vegetarian place.,6,8
Why am I watParkng you cut your hair?,"If I do it at home, I'm the one who has to clean it up.",8,15
Does that mean you like your new life?,"If you're asking if your job is safe, that depends on what you have to say about the file you're holding.",8,21
"It doesn't seem like much of a case. Although, I'm sure I'm wrong!",You are. Tell me why.,13,5
"Guy collapsed after being on his feet for hours on a hot day without breakfast, so! that's really weird.","E.R. found nothing wrong, then I decided I should test his wallet.",19,12
He's rich? That's why we're taking the case?,"No, we're taking the case because no one knows what's wrong with him. And he's rich.",8,16
"No, we're taking the case because no one knows what's wrong with him. And he's rich.",Dr. Adams. Give her the file.,16,6
This is my only copy.,"My M.O. depends upon the use of a team. Definitionally, that involves! more than one person. So I really have no choice. Give her the file.",5,26
You can't afford a team.,"Adams is free. And I'm referring both to her availability and her price tag . New girl, meet newer girl, and vice versa.",5,23
You said we were meeting for coffee.,"Well, when someone asks if you want coffee, they obviously don't just mean coffee. Wait! did you think I was referring to sex? Would you shut the blinds on your way out?",7,32
I thought you were referring to talking.,"Talking about medicine. Specifically, as it refers to the guy whose name is on the file she still hasn't handed you.",7,21
"I'm not working, House. I'm in the process of looking for a paying job.","In the meantime, there's no way a do-gooder like you has been volunteering all over town  ladling kittens, spaying soup!",14,21
There is a free clinic in Trenton.,"Well, think of this as today's free clinic. Only with fewer bums with herpes.",7,14
I don't think we actually have much of a case. I think it's just dehydration.,What happened the last time another doctor told you I was wrong about a case?,15,15
Most people with his kind of money are commissioning oil paintings of their Yorkshire terrier. Benjamin is sacrificing his own comfort to help others.,That's because helping others is his Yorkie oil painting.,24,9
"That's naive and sick. You really want to improve things? You do it through policy. This guy empties his pockets, what really changes?","That's right, all those babies with AIDS, they're just using us.",23,11
"This is your new reality. You've got your office. You've got neighbors. You've got one employee, one volunteer. Until she finds actual, paid work, or gets sick of you.",I talked to Chase and Taub. They're willing to come back.,29,11
"You've got two choices, House. You can recognize that your Patient is just a very nice, healthy guy, and send him home, or you can consider altruism a symptom. In which case, you cannot take his money.",Send him home. And check with admitting for the net worth of all new Patients.,37,15
"I'm not coming back, House.","Technically, you're back right now.",5,5
"I need you to stop calling me. First 17 messages were cute, but",I'm putting the band back together.,13,6
"I'm not a doctor anymore, House.","The job went away, but not the profession. You look healthy, so! that's not it. You met a boy. Or a girl. Fall in love, wanna be happy. You decided to! enjoy what time you have left. You're going to Thailand.",6,41
Turns out I like boring.,"No, you wanna like boring. But if you actually liked boring, you would have figured that out in fifth grade, when you were bored.",5,24
Patient got tachycardic to 185. We pushed 18 milligrams adenosine. There's definitely something wrong with him.,"Which is awesome. Now there's something to cure, which means there's something to be disproportionately financially grateful for.",16,18
You don't think defying huMan nature is neurological?,Racing heart: Medical condition. Bleeding heart: Stupid condition.,8,8
"Are you saying that because you beliEve it, or because it's in your financial best interest to think his generosity isn't just temporary?",I'm told that some people are just nice. I'm trying to embrace that wisdom.,23,14
Benjamin's been taking allergy medication the last few weeks. Long QT syndrome can be medication-induced.,"Flush him with saline, get rid of the antihistamines, then do an EKG. No, wait. I'll do the flushing. Take the damn 2.00. She hasn't Even sipped the coffee.",15,29
"I'll give a million dollars as an endowment to the hospital, earmarked for diagnostics.","Wow. I am an opportunistic ex-con who just gave you a two-minute sob story as step three in my master plan, and you've offered me a million dollars. Which is step 17.",14,32
"You can't take sex from a sexaholic. You can't give booze to an alcoholic, and you can't take this guy's money.",Could be wrong about the symptom. I'm wrong all the time.,21,11
Taking money from a sick person is ethically suspect at best.,"What is this, Canada? All we do is take money from sick people.",11,13
"Actually, the difference is pretty much a million dollars.","He came up with the figure, not me.",9,8
He lost his wife because she couldn't accept not being filthy rich.,She's not drinking the coffee either.,12,6
You're not a stranger. And your perverse view of the world is making you force a neurological component onto an obviously cardiological,"Your parents didn't love you enough. So you need to prove your superiority. Or they love you too much, so you need to prove your humility. Or it's just rich guilt. I'm betting on the last one.",22,37

"Shut up. Look, I'm not sure what you were trying to aParkEve. I'm nEver quite sure. But you were actually a friend to me when I needed it. I don't wanna come back to work for you.

That is six miles out of my way.,"Oh, okay, then. Guess I'll get something from the hospital cafeteria, which is where I get all my meals since I can't go anywhere.",8,24
Your guy just signed up to donate a kidney to my Patient with renal failure.,Did he meet your Patient with renal failure?,15,8
"Don't say that. House, she really needs this kidney.",He's not better. His mental status is declining.,9,8
Or he's doing an amazing thing for another huMan being.,I thought it was an ethical no-brainer that we can't take stuff from sick people.,10,15
His symptoms have gone away.,Not all of them. Offering an organ to a stranger is a symptom.,5,13
A couple dozen people a year make undirected kidney donations.,"Yeah, how Many of them are also in the process of pauperizing themselves?",10,13
"If the guy threw himself on a grenade, he'd be a hero. If it saves a life, who cares?","You do! Yesterday, when you made the exact opposite argument. If there's Even a chance I'm right, it'd be dangerous to give his kidney to someone else.",19,27
More dangerous than complete renal failure? My Patient needs this. Now.,"Yeah. If only we could kill 60,000 more people a year, all would be golden.",11,15
"I've been saying all along this could be Whipple's. Causes arrhythmia, tremor, and mental changes.",Bad idea. There's no joint pain. Where's Adams?,15,8
I'm here because I have time and you have a crisis and I,We're too busy for rationalizations. Patient made a big downgrade in his personal life. He's pRobably not eating all that healthy.,13,21
"Joint pain is common, but not definitive. Whipple's explains all of his symptoms, including the personality change. And it would respond to antibiotics, which is why he started to feel better. Which doesn't mean he's not still sick.",You were right. Counts for nothing if you can't defend it. Book a procedure room. Do an upper endoscopy and run a PCR test for Whipple's.,38,26
You were right. Counts for nothing if you can't defend it. Book a procedure room. Do an upper endoscopy and run a PCR test for Whipple's.,Guilt. You feel guilty about leaving.,26,6

That's my lotion. And it's not in the pool.,"No, it's on the palms of his hands. In the pool is the neighbor's daughter. Or the neighbor's hot wife. Here's some lube. Sorry. Too late for your eyesight.",9,29
Endoscopy didn't rEveal any lesions in the small intestine. I'm running PCR test now.,Found it in my office. Appears to be a gift. That can't be good.,14,14

I don't like owing people things.,"So either you're so insecure that you feel like you need to always have the upper hand, or you're so arrogant that the notion of a favor is insulting to you. Or it's your family, some kind of immigrant pride thing. I'm betting on the last one.",6,47
I just don't like it. It makes me feel! icky.,That's the reason? Ickiness? You nEver Even tried to analyze this? It's Even crazier than the gift thing.,10,18
House! there's no sign of tropheryma DNA. It's not Whipple's.,Well! we did what we could.,10,6
Almost always hits the kidneys.,"Ah, Dr. Foreman. Perhaps you can help us. I can't decide whether to take out an ""I told you so"" ad in the New England Journal or stay classy and just spray-paint it on your car.",5,36

I assume you dosed the Patient because you're really certain he has a neurological condition?,I assume you're interpreting my actions in the best possible light 'cause you didn't get the job? What's with you and Park?,15,22
"Oh, now I just want to win.",What was in the box?,7,5
"Nah, that's not gonna do it. You're up against a lifetime of training. If you wanna win, you gotta do something she can't possibly reciproCate. You gotta push her neuroses to the point where Even she thinks that she's crazy.","One more favor. Then I promise, I'll leave you alone forEver. Or I'm lying. Either way, it's more interesting than whatEver you're doing now.",40,24
"Arrhythmia, muscle tremors, and, yes, mental changes. If his heart doesn't rupture, he's liable to rip it out and give it away.","You know, the ""down"" vibe in here is totally ruining my Charlie's Angels fantasy. And that haircut isn't helping, either.",22,20
"And if it is acute intermittent porphyria, that would explain why his symptoms keep recurring.",It's unlikely! but it's possible. What else? I said what else?,15,11
You think he's allergic to Iodine?,"No, again. Just don't interrupt me. Thirteen was right. This is a thyroid issue. He has Plummer's disease. He has a nodule in his thyroid. It produces excess hormone. Not enough to test abnormal, just more than his brain is used to. Just enough to make him irrationally generous, make him vulnerable to overheating.",6,54
Then you pumped his body full of Iodine and kicked him into thyrotoxicosis.,"I said don't interrupt. But, yes, you're right. Take out the nodule, he'll be fine.",13,15
"Benjamin's room-- Benjamin is in his bed, with a gauze in his neck. House is sitting beside him, reading a 'Guitar' magazine. Benjamin wakes up.","Two days, one surgery. I now accept that you're all better. Where's my money?",25,14
When you're facing death! some things come into focus. My wife!,You love your family. You want them back. Your altruism was always a symptom.,11,14
"No, it wasn't. I'm still gonna",Keep less? How much less? Just enough to spoil your kids?,6,11
I don't wanna give you money because you're an ass.,I was an ass last week.,10,6
I love my family. I want to be with them. That doesn't make me a bad person.,No. It makes you a healthy person.,17,7
Your car is getting fixed. You're right. She went for it.,Good work. Need a lift tomorrow? 'Cause your car is still in the shop.,11,14
"PPTH lobby-- Thirteen meets her girlfriend in the lobby, and kisses her. Just when they are about to leave, House calls her.",Thirteen. Wait a minute. You're fired.,22,6
"Now what? House, I'm starving.",I'm not joking. You're fired. Don't come in tomorrow.,5,9
You're trying to save me.,Yes! I think that little of you and that much of me.,5,12
"Central serous retinopathy. It's linked to type ""A"" personalities.","Funduscopic exam was normal. If you don't let me read my email, then I won't be able to read the email to the entire staff. From your ex-boss. Thank you. ""Last month, I had an incident involving another P.P.T.H. employee. Though I can't speak to the details of the case while my disciplinary hearing is pending, I want you to know that I have completed voluntary sexual harassment training.

"He grabbed it, he apologized for grabbing it, and now he's taking classes because he grabbed it.","The classes make him sympathetic. Which, in turn, makes his unrepentant attacker! Evil. Which, in turn, in turn, makes you so fired.",17,22
100 bucks says I won't get fired.,"Oh, you don't wanna bet me.",7,6
The bet's that I'll get fired after my hearing!,"I'll take that action too, but you're already a C-note in the hole.",9,13

"Things don't seem small anymore, they I woke up from a nap and, uh, Everything went from really small to really huge.","Well, then, these giant balls of medicine are not gonna work anymore. The change actually makes things simpler. Your occipital lobe is acting up, giving you a migraine.",22,28
trying to find money in our budget so we don't have to move our operations overseas.,"I get it. Answer's no. Shouldn't have said anything. I'm just glad that the symptoms showed up before you left for Parkna. 'Cause I'm not sure the doctors over there would be so optimistic, considering! How they look down on mental illness.",16,42
What are you guys talking about?,"Oh, just how different the two cultures are. For example, our opinions on mental illness. Here, it's considered a normal and treatable condition. There, it's taboo enough to destroy a high profile business deal.",6,34
Let's try the medication first. How much do you want?,"You're hired! Oh, you guys are gonna love Doctors Chase and Taub. Keep your Nazi sentiments quiet around the little one.",10,21
He's destroying thousands of jobs.,"Jobs are not being destroyed. They're being reloCated. The fact that you see that as inherently bad means you're an irrational patriot. To put it another way, a patriot.",5,29
Patriotism is natural. We've always relied on our tribes to keep us safe. It's helpful for society if its members have positive feelings about that society.,"Iranian women. Drag Queens in Uganda. Patriotism is nothing but loyalty to real estate, real estate that's been conquered 800 times by 800 different regimes with 800 different cultures. But each time, it's just the best. I claim this burger in the name of Queen Isabella of Spain.",26,48
I think it could be hyperviscosity syndrome. Are you sure Foreman's okay with this thing in his office?,He's nEver gonna know. He's actually in here right now.,18,10

If it makes Andrews look sympathetic!,Copying him makes you look pathetic. And I will pay you not to go to anger Management classes.,6,18
What about another clotting pRoblem? Factor 5 Leiden deficiency.,It's possible. Adams is the one who needs to deal with her anger.,9,13
"Well, their company's making a decision I strongly disagree with.",Yet you were nEver anything but courteous to the racists and rapists in prison. Those guys made decisions you supported?,10,20
I was at a job interview.,You got to work at 9:15. Closest hospital with an opening in your specialty is 45 minutes away. It's not possible. My condolences.,6,23
I wasn't at a funeral.,That just leaves! Everywhere but a job interview.,5,8
That just leaves! Everywhere but a job interview.,Who goes there? REveal yourself!,8,5
But he's the chair of the disciplinary committee. Forget about the bet.,You two really need to do your homework with me. Treat the Patient with activated protein c.,12,17
"And if he has Factor 5 Leiden deficiency, he'll throw another clot.","Exactly. It's a conclusive test. There's no actual risk. As long as you're both paying attention, and are both good enough to work here.",12,24
Not interesting. Already went away.,Doubly interesting. Means we have to explain the arrival and the departure.,5,12
"Oh, you will. And! I'll deny it, and he'll beliEve you. But then these two beliEve that the policy of protecting American jobs starts at home. So they'll nEver testify against me. And you won't be able to prove anything.","Now, if I punched him in the face, that he could prove.",40,12
I remember you saying something about how loyalty to real estate was stupid.,"This is about reclaiming stolen property! Loyalty to real estate is stupid, because loyalty is stupid.",13,16
"First patriotism, now loyalty. You hate ice cream too?","French vanilla, yeah. To willfully identify yourself as something else is a perversion of self-expression.",9,15
I had a thought. Other than the fact that loyalty is the basis of all meaningful relationships. The daughter said that her mother died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. What if she was misdiagnosed?,Dutch chocolate's not bad. Gotta give 'em that.,32,8
"Her lymphoma could have been caused by a virus, HTLV-1, which our Patient contracted through having sex with his wife.","In other words, loyalty gave him cancer. I like it. Start him on radiation.",20,14
Chang and Eng Bunker. It's the most famous conjoined twins in history. 2011 is the bicentennial of their birth.,The best Halloween costumes are always the ones that need an explanation. What took you so long? I already lost one of them.,19,23
You need help with the lacerations?,"No, I think I got palliative. Why don't you take prEventative?",6,11
PrEvent what? He got in a fight.,Which he started. Which means he's both irascible and stupid.,7,10
"I told the drunk, racist frat guy the proper term is ""conjoined twin,"" not ""Siamese.""","I can't comment on the drunk or the frat. But Chang and Eng were both, in fact, born in Siam. And they were, in fact, twins. If your name was Richard, it would be okay for me to call you a Dick. But maybe some of the tripe you learn in anger Management class might help keep this guy out of here the next time.",15,65
I thought you wanted me to help him with his anger.,"No, I got Everything I need.",11,6
EKG and troponins were equivocal. It's not Even clear if our Patient just had a heart attack or what it was.,"Let's look at segmental wall motion abnormalities. Get him an echo to confirm. I need 200,000. His company's lost one third of its value since he was admitted.",21,28
And you want to do some insider trading? I take it felonies aren't a violation of your parole?,"It's not insider trading. Just betting on myself to solve the case. Once we cure him, share price goes up, I pay you back.",18,24
I'm not loaning my boss money.,"Fine. I'll make you a counter. 100,000. 20,000. I'll buy options instead of shares. More risk, but more upside. But that's as low as I'm gonna go.",6,27
If! you double your clinic hours. Six a week. I've seen how you disrespect those Patients.,So you want twice as Many of them disrespected?,16,9
"Spend more hours with them, you'll treat them more huManely.","And this time, a land war in Russia will be a good idea.",10,13
"Here's what I'm thinking. You went to a parole hearing, where one of your old Patients was denied. Hence the attire, hence the tardiness. And, most important, hence the anger. You think you can restore the cosmic balance by doing extra good here. More annoyingly, by having me do it. And deal!","Of course, you know! this means war.",52,7
"If the plumbing's fine, check the electrical. EP study.","Nice idea. Even has a metaphor in it. Not worth more than my honor. But delightful, all the same.",9,19
I'm not going to lose. My college roommate is the editor of the Yale Law Review. She's writing my opening statement.,"You will be eloquent in your loss. This case boils down to he said, she said. He said, ""I've been working at this hospital for 15 years and I'm taking self-improvement classes."" She said, ""I've been a fellow for two months, and I'm kind of weird.""",21,46
I already told Foreman he'd been drinking that night.,"Andrews was taking sexual harassment classes, not AA. That means he didn't get in trouble for drinking. Which means that Foreman signed off on it, which means that he set all the wheels in motion. Forget that. Wild speculation. Go do the EP study.",9,44
Then why isn't he saturated?,"Seems healthy to me. Let's release him. My option to sell Barton Foods at 34 is about to expire. So they thought the Patient would be better by now. Instead, I am going to lose 20,000.",5,36
"And extrapolating, tomorrow you'll owe just shy of 1 million.","It's your own fault. You forced me to go with the options here. Your damn anger issues are screwing with my finances. Regular stock this time, nice and safe.",10,29
I'm not angry. I don't know if you're trying to make me angry.,You refuse to bet on yourself. That means low self-esteem.,13,10
"So if I give you 200,000, I'll feel smart and pretty.",Low self-esteem can be brought on by exposure to one's relatives. Nice clothes and anger! Classic symptoms. Family gathering. You were late the other day 'cause you were having breakfast with Grammy Adams or Cousin Itt. And she was nagging you about finding a husband.,11,45
Low self-esteem can be brought on by exposure to one's relatives. Nice clothes and anger! Classic symptoms. Family gathering. You were late the other day 'cause you were having breakfast with Grammy Adams or Cousin Itt. And she was nagging you about finding a husband.,"Ah, ah, ah, ah! No spoilers. They ruin Everything.",45,9
That's my old boss. You don't actually think this is neurological.,"I don't know what it is. Maybe I should just accept the Patient's death, if getting help can lead to awkwardness.",11,21
"I don't know what it is. Maybe I should just accept the Patient's death, if getting help can lead to awkwardness.",Dr. Andrews. My associates. Doctors Adams and Park.,21,8
Uh! well! It sounds like there could be spinal cord involvement. Have you considered normal pressure hydrocephalus?,"Okay, normal pressure hydrocephalus going once. Normal pressure hydrocephalus going twice!",17,11
Then it's a good thing he has A.D.S.,"Do you really beliEve in this diagnosis? Because if this is just a pissing contest, you are at a sEvere anatomical disadvantage.",8,22
She's not yours to fire.,"You guys better fire her for insubordination, 'cause she went rogue, and my Patient is now in a coma.",5,19
I can't beliEve you did that.,Right back at ya. Our Patient's dying. We need theories.,6,10
It's gotta be normal pressure hydrocephalus. Andrews predicted the coma.,"Yeah, but Even a broken doctor's right twice a day. Patient wasn't wet, wobbly, or wacky. Coma had to be a lucky guess.",10,23
"If you didn't think he was right, then why did you want us to collect his spinal fluid?",I didn't. I wanted you to do a tilt table test.,18,11
You have a wonderful way of communicating.,"I knew Park wanted to do a tilt table. She listens to me, I waste an hour. If she defies me! Then I get the test I want and my 100 bucks. Up high.",7,34
Yes! Now I'm angry. Let's run the test for normal pressure hydrocephalus.,No. What else would explain our symptoms and make our Patient go into a coma during that test? How 'bout hepatic encephalopathy?,12,22
"No, we already tested his liver enzymes. They're normal.",Or his liver's so far gone it can't Even produce enzymes.,9,11
"Biopsy was clean. It's not his liver. I also ran the spinal fluid test, and you were right that Andrews was wrong. His ICP was not normal. It was elevated. What about HTLV?",We ruled that out three days ago.,33,7
"Because of his heart pRoblems, but","Once something gets taken off the board, I'm the only one who's allowed to put it back on.",6,18
"You owe me 106,804 Yuan. Or 100 U.S.","God, but you're petty. Okay, so! two options. Either we figure out what's wrong with this guy, or we figure out how to make this company profitable in New Jersey.",8,30
"Get out of here, House!","This diagnosis was brought to you by the letter ""Y.""",5,10
So I'm gonna be completely cured.,"It's not all about you. Your stock price will be completely cured. Once you sign this. It's a press release. It says that you're healthy, you're going back to work, and you're signing the lease that officially moves the company to Parkna.",6,42
"He just woke up. Dad, you don't have to deal with this right now.","Ah, mm, yeah, actually! he does. 'Cause the market opens at 9:00 a.m. And this means a lot to me. You may remember me from the time I saved your life.",14,31
"No, you didn't. I made this bet so you'd stop actively trying to fire Park so you'd be neutral. You went out of your way to help her. She obviously earned your respect, passed whatEver test you","I sabotaged her hearing. You do read the school paper, don't you?",37,12
"If you had sabotaged her hearing, she would have gotten more than a slap on the wrist. What you actually did was make her emotional and make the board members see her as a victim.",'Cause the panel feels badly for incompetent doctors who nearly kill people.,35,12
"You know that Everyone on that panel hates you. You know the minute you recommend firing anyone, they start discussing how big a bonus to give them.","That's just hurtful. The fact is, winning 100 from you gives me more pleasure than winning 100 from her. Here's your five grand.",27,23
Just take it. Trust me.,Found her sleeping in the Park. Said she ran away because her daddy didn't love her. And that is exactly what happened! as far as you can prove.,5,28
Congratulations. You're not going to jail! today. But you do know I just can't let this slide. You need to keep up your rep.,Fine. Clinic hours. I'll double them.,24,6
Okay. 12 hours a week.,No! Three times two equals six.,5,6
And 3 times 2 times 2 is 12. I know about your deal with Adams.,Call Chase and Taub. Get 'em in here. The boys are back.,15,12
It wasn't my boyfriend. It was my husband. I was at my Lawyer's office signing the divorce papers.,Wow. I missed the fact that you were married.,18,9
We've been separated for almost a year.,So! old news? No anger left? It's all bought and paid for.,7,12
Male Patient went into v-fib but shows no signs of heart disease,What was he doing when his heart decided to do the mambo?,12,12
"According to my calendar, I'm a week early.","Beard's a nice touch. Lets Everyone know that you're not a teenage girl. Oh, now, you two make a cute couple. And you two! It's not important.",8,27
And I look forward to working with you as well.,"He's lying, not just Taub! the Patient. These abrasions on his knees! they're minty fresh! about ten hours old.",10,19
He got them playing flag football.,"He said he got them playing flag football. I'm sure that's true if ""flag"" is a euphemism for ""penis"" and ""football"" is a euphemism for ""entering a vagina.""",6,28
Why would I? They look just like me.,But they will grow. Find out what else he's lying about. Do an exercise test! see if you can get him to go back into v-fib again.,8,27
But we could end up causing another cardiac arrest.,Hopefully. Then we'll know what set it off.,9,8
He means it's better to do it here where we can revive him than have it happen somewhere else.,"The prodigal son has returned. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go slaughter a fatted calf for lunch.",19,20
It's his heart we're worried about. The test will monitor its rhythm so we can check for any abnormalities.,I spent a month in solitary. You don't think I can keep this up all day?,19,16
I have a headache. Could you just lower your voice?,Chase and Taub are back!,10,5
You want me to pick up an ice-cream cake?,I also think that Taub has brought his little Taubettes into work with him today.,9,15
Why would he do that?,"Because I didn't give him time to do anything else. Then I started wondering, who'd be sappy enough to watch them for him?",5,23
"I understand your confusion. I was eating a baby for lunch, and! I have a massive migraine. Will you please just go away?",You should pRobably lie down and rest.,23,7
Yeah. I was trying to.,Oh! There is one more thing.,5,6
It's extreme and reckless. That's House. You get used to it.,Or I fire you. Look what I found! Kiddie-winkies! I wonder who they belong to.,11,15
I'm not letting you DNA test my kids.,"Already did. This swab's for you. Fine. If you don't mind paying a fortune in Parkld support for some other guy's kids, no skin cells off my cheek.",8,28
Myocarditis! viral infection weakening the wall muscles. We need to biopsy his heart to confirm.,Myocarditis wouldn't cause a seizure.,15,5
Could be genetic! Brugada Syndrome.,"Oh, my God. Two prodigal sons. Come on. Let's hug it out.",5,12
"You really like the idea, or you just want to grab some hair for a DNA test?","It's a stupid idea. We would have seen evidence of Brugada in the E.K.G. You know, this is! this is just messing with my feng shui here. What about over there?",17,31
"I'm sorry. I thought I was here to treat the Patients, not entertain you.","Would it hurt to do both? Oh, this is much better! I said it was boring. I didn't say it was wrong.",14,22
He doesn't have photic epilepsy.,"I know, because he has a pheochromocytoma.",5,7
You said I was wrong.,"You were wrong not to rule out epilepsy first. That only takes a couple of hours. Finding a tumor that's flushing adrenaline through his system is gonna take all night. Monitor his brain activity, start a continuous urine test and blood draws Every two hours.",5,45
"I can't! I have my kids! Wilson's leaving in, like, minutes!",Chase and Adams can do the test.,11,7
Where is the construction crew?,"Well, I'm not gonna make them work day and night. So I chose night.",5,14
"It's not meningitis. His neck isn't stiff, and his mental status is normal.","He's only guessing. I'm talking to Taub. He can't say ""my kids"" until he lets me test them. Tell me about the love shack where he cheated on his bride.",13,30
"Lab tests show the bed tested positive for, uh, semen, vaginal secretions, saliva, and fecal matter, both huMan and animal.",PRobably want to boil the kids for a couple hours when you get home.,20,14
The bathroom also tested positive for five different types of pathogenic bacteria.,Fusobacterium necrophorum was one of them.,12,6
"The bulge in his neck. The bacteria colonized his parapharyngeal space, moved into his jugular vein, causing a thrombus! Lemierre's Syndrome. Treat with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.

"We could be dealing with an alcoholic going through withdrawal. It explains his heart, seizures, and liver failing.",But not his swollen lymph nodes.,18,6
Why are we stealing cable from here? We don't Even have a TV in our office.,"I'm an ex-con, trying to adjust to a world that's passed me by. Stealing's all I know! that and the fact that I was right about what's wrong with our Patient. Just wrong about what?",16,35
"Cultures take time, and his liver doesn't have much left.",That's why we're gonna blast him with broad-spectrum antibiotics.,10,9
Not if we get him a liver transplant first and then treat him with a broad spectrum.,"And old team for the win! Not that I'm keeping score. It's more of a grid where I assign numerical values to determine who gets raises, vacation time, and my respect.",17,31
Some people think it's burning now. Maybe if Everybody didn't lie!,"Aw, that is cute. I'm talking about your breasts. They always get perky when you're being painfully earnest. Truth. It's uncomfortable, isn't it? More truth! I only noticed because Chase was staring at them. He'd nEver admit it, because he doesn't want to offend you. Same reason he'd nEver tell you that he's thought about having sex with you. Although, to be fair, Every Man you've Ever met has thought about having sex with you. They'll lie, because if you knew! you pRobably wouldn't want to have sex with them. And that's just some of the lies from the last minute. And here's a bigger one! you already know this, but you pretend you don't because it makes you feel civilized. Most people find it easier to ignore the truth. Ask Taub. Our Patient can't wait for a transplant that's nEver gonna come. We need to get reckless and extreme. C.T. his liver, find the damaged area, and cut it out. Hopefully, what's left will be enough so we can start treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.",11,175
Liver function has improved 30! buys us a few extra days before he'll need a transplant.,"Interesting question is, why is it regenerating?",16,7
"Interesting question is, why is it regenerating?",And scene. Now we're back to boring reality reality. His liver was in shock before. He's been having an allergic reaction since he got here.,7,25
We need to run a scratch test to find out what set it off.,Or who. This all started when he cheated on his wife.,14,11
He's allergic to a person?,"Or something she's wearing! makeup, perfume, birth control method, her ""Hello Kitty"" doll. Two of you go find her and find out what. Two of you start treatment with corticosteroids and epinephrine while you run the scratch test.",5,38
Is Everyone trying to think of an answer? Or is Everyone afraid to say,I take it you're in the latter Category.,14,8
There's no treatment for it.,It fits. Case closed. Why don't you go home and get some sleep?,5,13
I nEver heard of a neurological pRoblem that causes someone's skin to fall off.,"Because there isn't one. The aneurysm is just another symptom. It's not the cause. You add them all together, we get! We get Kaw! Kawas! Kawas! It's Kawasaki's Disease. It's autoimmune.",14,31
"Yes, we knew what ""kawah"" meant. We just figured since it basically presents only in Asian Parkldren!","Which you might have, by the way. Which is basically why we missed it. Rug burns! certain carpet-cleaning chemicals have been linked to it. Start treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Monitor the aneurysm. If it doesn't resolve itself we'll have to repair it. The rest of you! aren't surfing enough.",17,49
Where are the DNA results?,First admit that I was right.,5,6
You Manipulated me into doing it.,"Yeah, I'll admit to that. Now you admit that it was incredibly easy, because you can't cheat an honest Man.",6,20
I love them. I don't care if one of them isn't biologically mine.,What about both? Could be. Haven't read these. Now say I was right.,13,13
"No. I'll admit I was weak for a moment, but I'm not doing this. I don't care.","You do, and I'll prove it. I will shred this. I will call off my pool, return the money, and we'll forget all about it. Or we'll go to the light box in the lab and know the truth once and for all.",17,43

Head CT and cerebral angiogram are normal. Clotting parameters are normal.,You're forgetting the wrinkly clump in the middle of his shirt. Thought we'd diagnose the middle-aged clown first.,11,18
It's pRobably from my seat belt.,Wrinkle pattern's too varied. It looks like someone shoved you or grabbed you.,6,13
"PRobably from the diaper bag. If the Patient's using drugs, cocaine could have caused an arterial spasm in his brain.","The tox screen was clean. I'm gonna say it was the ex-girlfriend you cheated on, not the ex-wife you cheated with. If the latter was prone to violence, you'd have been scattered in various dumpsters years ago.",20,37
The Patient was punched in the groin. Could have triggered a massive sympathetic discharge.,"Carotid duplex is normal. Who's better qualified to be the daddy? The guy who spilled a little DNA in her gene pool or the guy who's gonna be there day and night to pass on important values like, not shtupping mommy after the divorce?",14,44
"So all parents screw up all Parkldren, but it makes some huge difference if I keep my daughter here or let her move? Endocarditis. Flipped a piece of vegetation into his brain, which could have broken up before the angiogram.","Transesophageal echo to confirm. Screwed up is your best case.

I need treatment for my type 2 diabetes.,There is absolutely no part of that sentence that is true.,8,11
"I've been experiencing weight gain, fatigue, and sluggishness.","Weight loss is a symptom of diabetes. Fatigue is a symptom of thinking you have disease you don't actually have, and sluggishness is a synonym of fatigue.",8,27
I need Insulin. I know it.,"Much as I'd like to kill you by dangerously lowering your blood sugar, murder violates my parole.",6,17
That bloodwork is week's old. Test me again.,I am the test. The test is negative. The test also thinks you're a giant pain in the ass. That last insult was your cue to leave.,8,27
We need to talk about Saturday night.,"No, no, no, no, no. Historians will talk of Saturday night, not us. The legendary night, on which we watch Santos shatter Rubio's jaw and you epically pay me 50.00.",7,30
"I have a chance to really watch it. A Patient of mine has a pair of tickets he can't use, and obviously you're under House and office arrest.

"Yeah, no, it's not like it's serious. I-I checked online, and it's! asthma or something.","""Or something"" is the number one killer of teens with no medical degree. When was the last time he took you to see a doctor?",15,25
"Uh, like five months ago. We went a clinic in Trenton. I had strep throat.",You remember the antibiotic they gave you? Is it neomycin?,15,10
"Amoxicillin. So about the inhaler for my asthma, I was","Sorry! Hospital policy specifically prohibits me from giving meds to unrelated homeless people pretending to be father and daughter. Your pants are a size too short, so either you grew a couple of inches or you grabbed the closest size in a thrift store. And only you have dimples, which are adorable, but they're also an x-linked dominant genetic trait. Which actually doesn't prove anything. The fact that you didn't burst into tears tells me that you nEver thought he was your dad.",10,83
Let's get out of here.,"Since you're the brains of the operation, might wanna stick around.",5,11
"What, so I can get busted by Social Services?","No, so you can stop bleeding out of your ear. It's usually a sign of a skull fracture. Someone been using your head as a soccer ball?",9,27
Why'd you ask to meet us 30 miles away from the hospital?,"Because I can. Also, Chris Christie's blog says the pancakes here are the best. So! what do we got on this 18-year-old with the ear bleed and the breathing pRoblems?",12,30
CT confirms no skull fracture. And looking at her confirms she's not 18.,"Yes, she is. Says so in the file.",13,8
We can't treat an underage Patient without a guardian. We need to call Social Services.,"I cut a deal with the Patient. We don't call, she doesn't bolt.",15,13
No sign of malnutrition. Tox screen is clear. S.T.D. panel was negative. And! is that Foreman?,"Oh, my goodness, it is! Hi, Dean Foreman! Are you not gonna introduce us because we're married? Oh, no, wait  that's her.",16,23
"She's a pharmaceutical rep, and this is a working breakfast.",In a restaurant that's nowhere near your home or the hospital.,10,11
Would explain the lack of fEver. Pneumococcus is pretty common among the homeless population. We should find out if she's been vaccinated.,"Sure, ask her, and when she refuses to tell you anything, start her on ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.",22,17
And if she says she has been vaccinated?,"Then don't beliEve her, and start her on ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.",8,11
How about we don't beliEve she's gonna bolt and we call Social Services?,"While I'm in the little boys' room, you can pretend that I'm seriously considering that idea.",13,16
"Hello, good sir. My brother, the General here, gots the green-apple quickstep.","One of us is in the wrong time zone. And if it's me, I need to talk to a stockbroker and anyone from the Kennedy family, in that order.",12,29
"Well, he got the runs, and we do need him up and at 'em for battle tomorrow.","It's hardly authentic, coming to a newfangled clinic, especially with a Yankee doctor.",17,13
"Sir, are you questioning my resolve?","Yes, and your sanity. I'm multitasking.",6,6
"Uh, General! Don't light out. We swore that we would see the elephant together.","Well, far be it from me to come between two nut jobs and their ""elephant."" I could add some mercury, if you want to make it more authentic.",14,28
Fungal infection's off the table. What about transverse myelitis?,Not with normal posterior column function. I've been waiting to do this for months. Pull! Sights seem to be off on this.,9,22
We didn't call Social Services before because we didn't want the Patient to take off. Now she can't. There's no reason for us not to call.,"Well, how about the reason that there's no reason? This is working fine for me. Pull! Well, now, that one clearly took evasive action.",26,24
"You want to protect her because you think she's fine on her own, outside the system.",Does anyone have a position on our Patient's medical condition?,16,10
Could be endocarditis with septic emboli.,"Pull! I'd turn around and shoot you, but apparently I'd miss. There's no murmurs, no Osler nodes.",6,17
"You've nEver done this before, have you?","No, I have not. But all the time I had my ankle monitor on, I was furious that I couldn't.",7,20
Not once I call Social Services. I'm not giving up.,"You wanna bet? One shot, one birdie. You hit, you make the call. You miss, nEver mention it again.",10,19
No. Why would I agree?,'Cause your only other option is you call and I fire you.,5,12
Hiring a hooker to pretend to be a social worker?,"She took a bet that she knew she'd win. Frankly, I feel violated.",10,13
You should have told me you were treating an underage clinic Patient.,I was giving you the gift of deniability.,12,8
You've got nothing on me. Check your phone.,"Uh! my phone? Oh, right. Yes, I-I did have some pictures on that. But! I also have these. There's the two of you kissing over dinner. Busting a move in a night club. Is that your hand near her nether regions? Thanks again for taking off the ankle bracelet.",8,49
"I'm not gonna let you blackmail me, House.","Oh, of course not. There's no way someone of your integrity would let me compromise your job in any major way over some tawdry bit of gossip. But what about compromising it in a minor way? Reduced clinic hours. Unlimited Internet porn budget. That makes much more sense than the nuclear option of ruining both our lives. You can keep these. I got copies.",8,64
"Oh, of course not. There's no way someone of your integrity would let me compromise your job in any major way over some tawdry bit of gossip. But what about compromising it in a minor way? Reduced clinic hours. Unlimited Internet porn budget. That makes much more sense than the nuclear option of ruining both our lives. You can keep these. I got copies.",How I miss the sweet smell of stickin' it to the Man.,64,12
Adams is right. You're protecting this girl.,"No, I was wrong. It's the stench of moralizing. I'm protecting myself from meddling bureaucrats and parents.",7,17
"You admire this girl. She had a horrible home life, so she went out on her own. She's your road not taken.",I've always dreamed of living in an abandoned House with mold.,22,11
"House, all I'm accusing you of is having a connection with a Patient. This is a good thing.","It's not a good thing, 'cause it's not a thing.",18,10
You bet 100 bucks on a turtle race?,I paid Mr. Parkps 5 bucks to take a dive.,8,10
How'd the mom seem to you?,"If you're asking him if she looks like someone who beat her kid, you're a moron.",6,16
Ellen shouldn't have consent if she beat her daughter.,Doesn't matter if she beat her daughter. Only matters if Social Services says she beat her daughter. Good thing you made it all official.,9,24
Not initially. It was a pretty tough conversation. Neither of us is ready,You didn't need to shoot yourself. I could have given you a Section 8.,13,14
"We've hit the drills pretty hard, and by the fourth round, my hand went numb. The-the gun slipped and I only had blanks in it, but!",It's funny how nearly shooting your toe off cured that speech impediment.,26,12
Ah. Yeah. Sorry about that. Sheldon's a! progressive.,Eh  compared to who? Rupert Murdoch?,8,7
Progressives are reenactors who strive for complete authenticity. They nEver drop character while in uniform.,Whereas you just dabble in crazy.,15,6
"Sheldon and I had a big falling out years ago. We only really started talking again because of the reenactments. They, uh! gave me my brother back.",That's a very moving story. Be a lot more affecting if you hadn't bonded over something so completely idiotic.,27,19
Explains esophageal ulcers and her other symptoms.,"If only it would explain why we've nEver seen her drunk, drinking, or detoxing.",7,14
CT didn't show any signs of an aneurysm.,"Did I mention they come and go? Much as your presence may cause objects to become engorged with blood, sometimes aneurysms just aren't in the mood.",8,26
Alcoholism and Berry aneurysm are both valid theories. I think we should discuss this with the Patient and her mom.,"Why? We discussed it right here. Go tell 'em she needs a cerebral angiogram to loCate the aneurysm, then surgery to repair.",20,22
The Patient asked me what I thought.,"I pay you to think inside this room. Outside this room, I pay you to parrot.",7,16
It's her choice. She has the right to know!,It's a medical choice that you turned into an extension of your baggage and hers. You told the mom something you want to beliEve because you don't want to beliEve that this girl might be doing fine parent-free. Which also happens to be what the mom wants to beliEve.,9,49
You think she wants to feel responsible for her daughter's illness?,That Woman sees Everything to do with her daughter through! guilt-colored glasses. It's all her fault.,11,16
House! don't! bully her. She's overwhelmed enough.,"Well, it's nothing compared to how she's gonna feel when her daughter dies from the aneurysm she decided not to treat.",7,21
You must be Dr. House.,I save my appearances for when parents are on the brink of doing something incredibly stupid. Your daughter has a Berry aneurysm. She needs surgery. What she does not need is you making this or any other decision.,5,38
"Well, I can't just leave this up to her.","Then leave it up to me, and just leave.",9,9
Ohh. I'm not gonna abandon my daughter.,She hates you. It's actually not such a big deal. There's plenty of kids who hate their parents. What makes it a big deal is that she should hate you. Playing the biology card doesn't change anything except where she lives. Your daughter is better off without you. So! let her be better off without you. I'm gonna do the surgery. I'll take the fallout from Social Services.,7,68
And you tested her  see if you could get her back on drugs and out of her daughter's life.,That was to show Adams that Mommie Dearest hadn't changed. I'm taking a principled stand against idealism.,20,17
"Your Patient's stable? Well, maybe Adams was right. The illness is alcohol-related.","Well, I hope so, considering it's what we're treating her for.",12,11
You-you hope you're wrong for the sake of the Patient?,I hope that I'm right but the aneurism bursts without killing her. Call me a softie. Or the mom agrees to an autopsy so I can prove it.,10,28
"But all the menfolk been eatin' it, and we the only ones that's sick.","Which one of you is the cheap bastard? Your uniforms. They're not wool. They're polyester. Cheap polyester. Which gets processed with a heavy metal called antimony. You wear badly processed polyester all day and night for days and nights, you get antimony poisoning, which caused your diarrhea and your numbness in your hands. And your collective vomiting.",14,57
Because they don't cost anything.,"Brother against brother. Now, that is authentic.",5,7
"She got a little better when we put her on steroids, which can attack tumor cells. Maybe she has cancer.","No hypercalcemia, no elevated blood proteins.",20,6
She and her mom mentioned a trip they took to Florida a couple years ago what about dengue fEver? Cholera?,"Great ideas, if dengue fEver or cholera laid in wait for two years before suddenly!",20,15
"Great ideas, if dengue fEver or cholera laid in wait for two years before suddenly!",Did your biological daughter go swimming in Florida? In a lake or a pond or an Everglade?,15,17
Uh!yeah. There's a canal near my mother's House. Do you know what's wrong with her?,Family vacations kill. Come with me. Don't want to explain this twice.,15,12
You're letting in the flies. And she needs an LVAD.,"No, she doesn't. Your daughter has ascariasis. It's a disease caused by a parasitic worm found in feces. Animals use the canal as a potty, the eggs from the feces ended up in Callie's intestines when she went swimming! where they hung out, quietly and asymptomatically, biding their time till, somewhere along the way, they got knocked loose. Maybe a dive in volleyball practice or maybe she slipped on her way into a soup kitchen. But once they hatched, the worms got to work on her lungs, her ear, the nerves in her legs. The worms got agitated by the steroids we gave her, which started them on their journey to the esophagus and, ultimately, to the heart. A few pills of Mebendazole! She'll be fine.",10,126
You got the ending you wanted.,"'Cause I was only looking to solve the case, not their lives. Now, I don't care if the people who work for me are screwed up. In fact, I Even encourage it. But absolution? You do that on your own time. Or not at all. 'Cause! clearly, you suck at it.",6,51
This is Mark Sanchez. Do you know what sound people make about him? Pffftt!,Working late? Husband have her tonight?,14,6
And Every night. She broke it off. It's for the best. I'm not really an affair guy after all.,"Sure you are, buddy. You just lost interest once it stopped being an affair. That's why you're reliEved. But don't worry  it's not gonna end here. You'll just have to get your adrenaline fix somewhere else. When that doesn't do it anymore, then you'll just! escalate things somehow. At least, that's what I've been told.",19,56
"Let the record show that we are officially convening a disciplinary hearing regarding the Events of February 3, 2012 in Patient room 209. Dr. House, this recording will be transcribed and published along with all supporting documentation and rulings. Do you have any questions before we get started?",Yeah. Who the hell are you?,48,6
"I'm Walter Cofield, Parkef of Neurology, Mercy Hospital. I'll be deciding your fate today.","Cofield. You were the Residency Director at Hopkins before you moved to Mercy, which means it's safe to assume that you trained Foreman. Which means it's also safe to assume that he trusts you.",14,34
"This hearing isn't about me, Dr. House. I know you'd like to make it about me, because then it wouldn't be about you.",It's interesting that he'd pick the old mentor to Judge the new one.,23,13
"Interesting, but not relevant. The facts of this case, on the other hand","The facts are in the file. If you have trouble reading my handwriting, give me a call. I'm going back to work.",13,22
"If I just consider the file, the facts aren't in your favor. The facts say you should be suspended, which, from what I understand, would mean a revocation of your parole.",The Patient was a 32-year-old high school chemistry teacher. He collapsed while out jogging. He was paralyzed in all four extremities despite the fact that the scans!,31,27
Show no sign of stroke or structural lesions.,Put out an APB for a car with a Man-shaped dent in the grill?,8,14
Those are Vicodin? Did you have surgery recently?,About a decade ago. My leg is no good at judging time.,8,12
Were you taking Vicodin during this case?,Uhh! Yes. And during about nine years of previous cases. My process is proven. Good things usually happen. Bad things sometimes happen.,7,22
"And when bad things happen, we should figure out what went wrong, so we can learn from it and correct it.",So that we can assign blame instead of recognizing that bad things sometimes happen. It was nobody's fault.,21,18
And why did House think that was stupid?,"Oh, come on. Unless you're an idiot, you know why I thought Park was an idiot.",8,16
Are you intentionally trying to get me to dislike you?,That wasn't me. The chair squeaked.,10,6
"You're testifying, for the record, that you actually used the phrasing ""unsquint your eyes""? It's not the place to exorcise your guilt just b","I actually used the phrasing ""unsquint your eyes.""",24,8
"But Chase, a doctor who actually takes the time to read the lab reports, has a point. The guy's potassium is off. Could be thyrotoxic paralysis. Start him on!","!steroids, PTU, and beta blockers.",29,5
Mm-hmm. And how did these orange smudges get on the Patient files?,"Seriously? That's your follow-up? I eat a lot of Cheetos, I forget to wash my hands. Is my snacking really relevant to this case?",12,24
Sounds like a very diplomatic way of saying he's lazy.,"That's also true. Either way, I'm covered. If you want an accurate Patient history, don't Ever talk to the Patient. Everybody lies. Except me. To you. Would nEver do that.",10,30
"Looks like you've gone viral, hon.","He had a loss of consciousness, temporary paralysis! But when I was told the Patient coughed up blood, then things really started to get interesting.",6,25
It might help if we knew the question.,How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs?,8,9
Maybe we can use a bronchoalveolar lavage to wash 'em out with water.,Sorry. My fault. Should have clarified. How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs without killing the Patient?,13,19
Silver sulfadiazine works well on chemical burns.,Burn cream would drown him faster than water. Well?,7,9
So you busted out the sulfur dioxide stink bomb?,It was a team-building exercise.,9,5
No. It was Manipulation. You were pressuring your team into coming up with unsafe medical ideas just to get out of that room.,"You say pressure, I say inspire. The usual safe ideas were not gonna work. Aerosolized heparin might.",23,17
How does Dr. House handle it when three smart doctors come up with three different but equally valid ideas?,I run a diagnostic trial.,19,5
I run a diagnostic trial.,"Start the Patient on high-dose steroids. Multiple birds, single stone. If Taub is right, then he will walk out of here cured. If Adams is right, he'll spike a fEver, get hypotensive, we can treat it. He can walk out of here cured. If Park is right, he goes all cuckoo's nest on us, we can cross ""brain"" off the list!",5,61

"Are you trying to make this easy for me? By your own admission, if you give the Patient steroids, two of the three outcomes are gonna make him worse.",What was making the Patient worse was not having a diagnosis. This was the fastest way to get it. It was a perfect diagnostic moment.,29,25
"In light of what happened, you still think it was the perfect diagnostic moment?",Yes. My theory accounted for all the medical outcomes. It did not account for the disobEdience of my own team.,14,20
So your position is that your team's disobEdience caused this?,That's not what I said.,10,5
"You said you didn't anticipate their defiance. You implied that all would have been fine otherwise. So who do you blame, Dr. Adams or Dr. Chase? Or both?",I don't blame either one.,28,5
"Got to move it, people.",My diagnostic test worked. It proved the Patient had a steroid-induced psychosis.,5,12
And that's what you took away from this situation?,The brain was not a symptom of an underlying disease.,9,10
I can't take my finger out. He'll bleed. I don't think he can take it.,Oxygenation's at 100. He's as ready as he's gonna be.,15,10
My friend is here because you didn't listen to me.,"I did listen to you. Chase didn't listen to me. At this point, being here makes you feel better. You're not helping Chase or our Patient. Fine.",10,27
It's a hospital. There are lots of doctors who can take care of him.,"And your thinking is that only you guys are qualified to sit in this room, doing nothing? If you're motivated by caring, just bear in mind he's a dediCated chemistry teacher with a pretty wife and adoring students, baby on the way.",14,42
"I don't think it was anyone's fault. I was angry, but I wasn't distracted. And I think that, if there's any chance I'm gonna walk again, it's because Dr. House is a genius.",How about warmth? Can you feel the sheets on your skin?,33,11
"House, if it's total paralysis, he must have!",Not necessarily. Think arteries. Blood flow to his spinal column is cut off. It's a clot in the radicular artery.,8,20
And if it's not a clot?,Then you can ask Foreman if hospital insurance covers ramp-vans.,6,10
Don't get too excited. We still got to get it out. Still could have done perManent damage.,Patient does not have autonomic dysregulation. There's blood in his urine bag. Kidneys are failing.,17,15
Are you really this indifferent to the fact that Dr. Chase is hurt?,"We're going off the record because this is irrelevant, or are you gonna hit me?",13,15
Why don't you go tell the guy you're sorry!,I didn't do anything wrong.,9,5
Coworker whom you've known for almost ten years who nearly died and who's still scared he may not walk.,Are you going to have me fired for bad Manners?,19,10

You've been wrong Every time.,"Yeah, well, not this time. The explosion in the classroom caused the cancer cells to break open. It's called tumor lysis syndrome. His body's flooded with an excess of phosphates, potassium, acids, all kinds of cancerous junk. It explains the paralysis, the bleeding, the heart and kidney issues, Everything.",5,49
What about the psychotic break?,Turns out we caused that. This is treatable. Okay? You have to tell the new doctors that he needs total body radiation and plasmapheresis.,5,24
He said you walked out.,"Well, I'm walking back. I'm not done testifying.",5,8
This case is a fiasco. Didn't sleep last night. Dr. House is obviously brilliant!,"Well, I think we've heard enough.",14,6
"I know. I came to speak with Dr. House. And when they told me he was in here, I thought I should say something. I mean! he wasn't the nicest doctor I've Ever met.","Well, I think we've heard enough.",34,6
"Good things usually happen; Bad things sometimes happen. The fact that that would-be widow came in just in time to sob all over your soft, mushy heart and the fact that her husband's gonna live does not change whether or not I did the right thing.",How'd you get the firing wire into the Vicodin bottle without me noticing?,46,13
Why'd I Even have to? What was the point of the orange hair?,"Your hair smelled like Adams. And since there's no way that you're doing her without me knowing, it means you were just doing her shampoo. Which means you were out late drinking with some new girl or, because there is no new girl, you were trying to make up time by showering at the hospital because you're too lazy to buy your own shampoo. So I found a way to let you know to not be late.",13,77
You couldn't just ask me to stop being late?,What fun would that be?,9,5
"None of this is fun, House.",They decided that your being stabbed! was nobody's fault. They're wrong. I'm sorry.,6,13
I was stabbed by a Patient. That'll teach me to overbill.,"If she likes crippled guys, I'm free for the next six minutes.",11,12
Does this look like a good time?,Sort of. At least as good as the other 12 times that I've called and paged you in the last three weeks.,7,22
Those times I just didn't feel like talking to you. Kinda like now.,"I'd apologize again, but I'm still waiting for you to accept the first one. You do work for me. I am entitled to ask when you're coming back.",13,28
Stress test too. It's not angina. So why the shoulder pain?,Is it possible that she hurt her shoulder?,11,8
Good to see you on your feet.,Patient's a nun? You turning back to your long-abandoned faith in time of trouble?,7,14
She was next up in the clinic. And I don't want your help.,You got stabbed. You blame me.,13,6
You got stabbed. You blame me.,But what did you learn about me that you hadn't known for years?,6,13
Maybe I was an idiot before and I'm not one now.,Or maybe the rEverse is true.,11,6
Thanks for all your help.,Your soul sister is having a fungal infection from the unprocessed wheat in the altar breads. Explains the shoulder pain and the jumbo lymph nodes.,5,25
Your soul sister is having a fungal infection from the unprocessed wheat in the altar breads. Explains the shoulder pain and the jumbo lymph nodes.,Thanks for all my help.,25,5
I need help with my Patient. She's vomiting. That's not from a fungal infection.,What are you planning to do now that you're not working for me?,14,13
I have no idea. Almost dying's been clarifying. I can do anything.,You can do anything. So you come back to the same building you've worked in for years. Guess you can cross that off your bucket list.,12,26
Can we get to my Patient sometime soon?,"As soon as you admit that you're a confused mess, sure.",8,11
"You'll help me. 'Cause Even though you don't find my case interesting, you find my interest in it interesting.","Well, when you put it that way! Ascending colangitis.",19,9
Ketosteroid lEvels are low. How can he be hyper-sexual?,He tried to tongue-kiss Park when you were closer. You think his sexuality is normal?,9,15
I need more help. My Patient has a new symptom. Ischemic foot. Get the lecture out of your system so we can talk about my case.,Let me start with an allegory.,26,6
Krav Maga. Which helped me block your shot and will continue to help me defend myself in a building full of drugged-up strangers.,"Taub has to accept that by instinct and genetics he is a coward, who's better off running and hiding at the first sign of danger.",23,25
I've already fended off six of your blitzkriegs in a row.,And the sEventh? And the eighth? And the Nth?,11,9
"If you get him, what's that gonna prove?","That unexpected things happen. By definition, no class can teach you to expect them. Which is why Taub is idiotic to study them, and you're idiotic to attach any significance to them.",8,32
That explains Everything but the lymph nodes. And any minor infection,Calcium channel blocker to treat.,11,5
It is gonna be hard. Not touParkng anyone.,Who knew mother inferior was a smoking hottie. No wonder you're playing handsies with her.,8,15
You think I'm hitting on a nun? Angry at God or I just need a challenge?,"Or you're terrified of intimacy, which is why you're a serial slut. But right now you're grasping at an emotional life raft. Ideally someone for whom intimacy's not an option. That actually makes sense, which I can't say about anything else you've been doing.",16,44
"Bounding, four-plus. It was a three-plus 20 minutes ago.","Twenty? Thought she just got here. That blood looks pretty dry. Cut yourself shaving? You know, that can happen when the nun you woke up with coughs blood on you.",9,30
Negative A.N.A. Where are you going?,Great thing about assigning Taub fraudulent lab work is you know exactly where he's gonna end up. Great thing about assigning Taub obviously fraudulent lab work is you get to watch his inner paranoiac at work.,6,36
Can we talk about my Patient?,Quite a journey. Starts with a surgical tool in your heart and ends with a surgeon's tool in a nun. What's the plan?,6,23
"Well, if it's not meaningless sex, kinda screams out for an end game. You're the dog that's chasing the popemobile. You sure you want!","Oh, my God. Taub is interrogating the janitor. He must think that I hired him to attack! actually, why didn't I do that? Plaques could be confused for nodules. Which would mean!",24,32
"Checked the anesthesia sheet, pressure was fine throughout. Thrombus?","That voice in the hall that none of us have any reason to be listening to is, not surprisingly, wrong. Abdominal ultrasound was negative.",9,24

She did. She wants to go back to the monastery.,So now you're preparing a Powerpoint presentation to keep her in your garden of earthly delights. You're an idiot.,10,19

"No, it's not. The Army issues anti-malaria medication.","And has done for ten years. That's the equivalent of 5000 generations of the Afghan mosquito, anopheles gambiae. That's plenty long enough to dEvelop a resistance. Anopheles, by the way, is Greek for ""useless.""",8,34

Taub confessed to telling Foreman to protect the Patient. Adams confessed to protect Taub. But your confession was just piling on. There's no rational reason for you to have done it.,25,43
And my punishment will be nothing. You wanted me to tell Foreman. Your ability to solve puzzles is the only thing that matters to you. And you're smart enough to know Even you'll lose your edge at some point.

"If you really wanted me to do nothing with this information, then why did you give it to me?","Because you were pining for a kid, and you deserved to know that you already had one.

"Aside from the guy in the book depository, the Kennedys had a lovely trip to Dallas. Repetitive blows to the head can cause chronic traumatic encephalopathy, symptoms of which are aggressive behavior and depression.",So your theory is that his aggressive behavior caused his aggressive behavior. He's not depressed. He's just bummed because he knows he's a talentless moron who's only one lost fight away from being a barista. I understand that can get to a guy after a while.,34,46

It's not guilt. Park is a friend.,"So it's guilt. Chase convinced you to leave mommy, and now he feels responsible. No MRI. Do a psych eval. If he doesn't start weeping again, send him home.",7,29
"That's a density. I know you think I'm convincing myself, but this brain has been hammered for years, meaning evidence may be subtle, but it's there.","Meaning you see what you want to see. Unless, of course, Chase is an idiot, and I do have brain damage.",26,21

Sensory involvement rules out ALS.,"Okay, yeah. Now this is interesting. We'll get back to the Patient in a second. Your issue is the same as Wilson's, except! you're haunted by the pitter-patter of tiny skanks. You don't feel guilty about getting Park thrown out of her home. You feel guilty about all the women that you've screwed over. My mother needs 1,000 bucks for snow tires.",5,62
"Paralysis has gone from his face to his arms, meaning it's descending, which is the hallmark of botulism.",So it was something he ate. How innocuous. You've overcome your bias by rEversing it. The only pRoblem is that being in love with a Patient is just as judgmental as being in hate. We didn't find any contaminated,18,39
The antitoxin could cause anaphylaxis. We need to test first to confirm.,"As if to prove my point, last time you said there wasn't enough time to test prior to a more dangerous treatment.",12,22

"I've known a lot of bullies  people who didn't like me because I'm short, people who didn't like me because I'm Jewish","Yeah, I get it. There's a long list of reasons not to like you.",23,14
"You relentlessly mock, but it's not for self-aggrandizement. It's because ideas are bigger than feelings. At least that's what I choose to beliEve.

I just had a light bulb. Maybe.,You can trust light bulbs.,7,5
"Stop. It's not prions. Epstein-Barr gave him mono. It also gave him Miller Fisher syndrome. The plasmapheresis played through the whistle. We gave it to him for MPA, but when he got worse, we took him off. When he got better, we thought it was the antitoxin. But it was actually the plasmapheresis still working. We had the right treatment, just the wrong diagnosis.",It was my metaphor that solved the case. Put him back on plasmapheresis. He'll be fine. Nice save. Didn't quite make up for being a siEve the rest of the game.,64,31
His mother is moving to Costa Rica. He asked if he could move in with me. And I said yes.,"Well, it's only six or sEven years. Unless he can't get into college, in which case, it's more a matter of your life expectancy.",20,24
"I said yes, knowing I'm not remotely ready for that, knowing he's not ready to be separated from his mother. This isn't the act of a mature, rational adult. I-I can't do this, House. You were right.",I have an idea! that can make this entire pRoblem go away.,37,12

"No. But he doesn't have cancer. We think it might be eosinophilic pneumonia. Maybe you didn't want to die, but you didn't care if you lived.",You insisted that I needed to see for myself.,26,9
No. He's dying. You've already had two near-death experiences.,Not that guy. The guy in the car accident. With the knife. I... I need to talk to him.,9,19
House? What did you see?,Nothing. Who's idea was that?,5,5
"House, you gotta talk about this.","If it's aggressive enough, it might have gotten past the steroids. Start him on cyclophosphamide.",6,15
I assume we're all fired.,"Should I fire myself, too? I thought it was Strongyloides, then I thought it was cancer. Little help here.",5,19
But why not one of the others?,You always had that phone in your hand.,7,8
We all have cell phones. That's not the reason. What is?,"If I died, you'd nEver get the job. I knew you wouldn't let that happen.",11,15
You don't think anybody else has any reason to care?,"Think this is starting to come back to me. Right, left, then repeat.",10,13
"If we knew, he wouldn't be dead.","So, that's it? You're just gonna give up?",7,8
"Patient presented with syncope. We thought it was threadworms, gave him ivermectin.","Thank you. Patient seemed... better, 'til his blood turned green.",12,10
Can we at least remove the body before launParkng into a purely academic exercise?,The Patient didn't respond to antibiotics or steroids.,14,8
"He's dead. There are only a handful of viruses that can cross between dogs and huMans, but they may not be connected at all. The dog was old. I've seen it before. They hang on way past their normal life expectancy to take care of their Masters.",Did you watch him take the pills? The ivermectin. Did you watch the Patient put them in his mouth and swallow them?,47,22
I don't know. I think so.,What kind of dog is that?,6,6
"They don't. I mean, it's used to treat heartworms in most dogs, but it'd be fatal if the...","Look familiar? I think the last time you saw it, it didn't have that dead dog's teethmarks on it.",18,19
I just put it on the bed tray to get him some water.,"When I asked you if you watched the Patient swallow the pills, the right answer was 'no'. Take his body down to the morgue.",13,24
"If you hadn't treated this Patient as a game, he wouldn't be dead.","Feeling much better, thank you.",13,5
I'm supposed to show you sympathy? He died... while his attending was lying on a hospital bed because he stuck a knife in a wall socket.,He died because a doctor made a mistake. He was an idiot.,26,12
"As soon as the pathologist cut into the lungs, we saw the threadworms.",You think it's fair that I fired all the other members of your team when you guys actually came up with the right diagnosis?,13,24
I keep replaying it in my mind. Did I drop the pills when I put them on the bed tray? Did I knock them over when I turned to leave?,You know he'd be alive.,30,5
I know! Forget the lecture and fire me already!,"If I was going to fire you, I wouldn't be giving you the lecture. I know you're not going to let anything like this Ever happen again. I'll see you tomorrow.",9,31
"If I was going to fire you, I wouldn't be giving you the lecture. I know you're not going to let anything like this Ever happen again. I'll see you tomorrow.",And I'm sorry to say... I told you so.,31,9
It was not a half hour. It was ten minutes. And he made copies of the ER records first.,"Less lip, more whip. I only agreed to take this case because you said that this Mocha Frappalicious would have whip on it.",19,23
You mean it appeared normal to the doc in the ER.,"Way to get right back on that horse, ""Thirteen"".",11,9

What did you call me?,I'm sorry. What do you people want to be called this week?,5,12
I'm nEver gonna remember that. Take Bosley and the other visible minority to the funeral home.,"The rest of you young white people, the world is your oyster. Get an MRI with contrast, EEG, LP, and blood panel. And, Angels, be careful.",16,26

Bosley! Tell whoEver's talking he's an idiot.,"Bosley. Either tell him he's an idiot, or tell me why I'm wrong.",7,13

"No, she's a vegetarian and only ate organic vegetables at that.",Tell him he's an idiot again.,11,6
The disease can be spread by brain tissue.,Which is very cool. Run with it.,8,7
"So because the answer might be ""cool"", you want us to do a brain biopsy on a twenty-four-year-old Woman?","No, because the answer is something cool, I want you to do a brain biopsy on a forty-eight-year-old dead guy.",19,20
I am not digging up a body without a court order.,Don't think of it as digging up a body. Think of it as keeping another one from being buried.,11,19

"Well, then it must be the kid.",You have oatmeal on your pants.,7,6
Do you have a camera in here?,No. I was guessing. He had oatmeal on his pants yesterday and the day before. Have one of your wives look after the spawn.,7,24
The doctor's lounge is covered in mud.,"Thirteen and Cutthroat Bitch had a disagreement, and the cafeteria was out of jell-o.",7,14
"There were pickaxes. Either you had them dig up a body, or you're building a railroad.",A little tiny piece of his brain. Seemed a waste. He wasn't using it anymore.,16,15
You get the results yet?,Does my breath smell bated to you?,5,7
Yes. Let me know when you hear anything. And get that mess in the shower area cleaned up.,I know just the guy.,18,5
"But don't worry, the one who didn't didn't stand on principle. He just had a diaper to change. I really think there are no bad choices in this group.",You guys don't wipe your feet when you come in the House?,29,12
And you can't ask Bosley because that'd look like you only hired the non-doctor to do non-doctor stuff.,"You keep stalling, you're still gonna clean up, but I won't let you have the mop.",18,16
Sample came back negative for Creutzfeldt-Jakob.,"Well, that discussion didn't last long.",6,6
I just don't know what else there is. We had an idea. It was wrong.,"Well, we can go home. I mean, we have no idea what's wrong with her. Which means it could be completely benign. Or, on the off chance that it's killing her, we could take it again from the top.",15,39
What are you talking about? She's right there.,"You sampled Every bodily fluid, peeked in her brain, violated a cadaver's privacy, dug up a body...",8,17

... but missed the fact she was still seeing things that weren't there.,Be nice if one of you Angels-slash-morons had a clue why.,13,11
We did a full history. She nEver mentioned seeing or hearing anything unusual.,"Oh, well, as long as she nEver said anything. How were you to know? Same thing with the spinal fluid? She tell you that was fine?",13,26
The labs were all clear.,"Then either we're about to meet the Alpha and Omega, or you missed something.",5,14
Seeing her dead mother's a hallucination. Not knowing she's dead is a delusion.,"You keep this up, you're gonna have to start wearing sexier clothes.",13,12

He had a dog. She's seeing Stark. Our last Patient.,"Well, if it's Stark, he wouldn't be haunting a Patient, he'd be haunting the doctor who killed him.",10,18
"Well, if it's Stark, he wouldn't be haunting a Patient, he'd be haunting the doctor who killed him.",PRobably? You think there's a possibility that the alternative is true?,18,11
We're wasting time. We ran thirty two gels. We could run a hundred more. Without knowing how her mother died...,"You're gonna have to run a hundred more. And by you, of course, I'm only referring to the people who care enough about huMan life to put in a full day. You wanna carpool?",20,34
H-how do you expect me to respond to this stuff?,Exactly like you just did. I have a theory. Maybe you can help me out. Black Mormon means masoParkst. Means kinky.,10,21
Exactly like you just did. I have a theory. Maybe you can help me out. Black Mormon means masoParkst. Means kinky.,I'm thinking that someone got hurt making the bastard. Am I right?,21,12
You leave my son out of this.,I wasn't referring to your kid's hypocrisy. I was referring to yours.,7,12
Why should I tell you? You're just going to tell me I'm lying or crazy.,Not gonna do that. I really need to know what she has to say.,15,14
You have a Grandpa Walt?,Nope. Which is what made me suspect that maybe she's not actually seeing into the afterlife.,5,16
What is this sudden obsession with the afterlife?,Only obsession is with the idiots in the right-here-and-now life who think there's an afterlife.,8,15
And you want me to...?,Nothing. Just need a place to hang low for awhile. I'm pretending to be spooked.,5,15
The one you don't beliEve exists.,"Exactly. The ghost is a hallucination, which is the result of a delusion which most likely is the result of a hereditary disease that her mother died from when the Patient was four.",6,33
And you think you can tap into her subconscious memory by tapping into her hallucination.,"Hmm-mm. She might not know what caused her mother's death, but she will know how she acted before she died.",15,20
"You're quite impressed with yourself right now, aren't you?","Who wouldn't be? Well, that should be long enough. Back in a flash.",9,13
He just went to get some warm milk.,"But your mom's still here, right?",8,6
She was just tired. And sometimes she would stay in bed all day.,Did she Ever fall down?,13,5
I thought that was from growing up on the farm.,"What about her hands? She Ever have any difficulty sewing, buttoning a shirt?",10,13

He's not a wuss. It takes a lot more strength...,"Hey, we didn't bet on how strong he was.",10,9
So you're gonna collect a hundred dollars and fire him because he has principles?,What's your agenda here? Obviously don't care about the hundred.,14,10
Does it annoy Wilson when you ask questions and ignore the answers?,"Very much. You only care about who I hire and who I fire, 'cause you miss going through my mail. You can't stop controlling me.",12,25
Too bad. You can't have it.,She'll take care of this.,6,5
She'll take care of this.,You can take it out of the 100 you're gonna owe me.,5,12
Not a metaphor. Look up.,You guys gonna shoot the breeze or you gonna do something about all that bleeding?,5,15
Which one of us is?,"Both of you. Together. Fighting. Passionate to prove the other one wrong. Couldn't care less about the Patient, but it all works out the same.",5,25
"This is a joke, right? He can't be right Every single time. You're feeding him your ideas just to embarrass us.","If I wanted to embarrass you, I'd... have you mop up the doctor's lounge.",21,14

"She was convulsing, delirious, and hyper-salivating. We had to knock her out with lorazepam.","Well, it's definitely not vascular.",14,5

"The Patient's not possessed, she's dying. You can mock me tomorrow.",You beliEve that the Book has all the answers.,11,9
Just shut up already! We got a Patient dying!,Either got to prescribe an exorcism or admit to me that Smith was a horny fraud.,9,16

I'm sure she did it. That's why she's getting the flower. It was beautiful.,She just overreached. She got into your head.,14,8
She just overreached. She got into your head.,"She owned you. Planting the idea was good. Letting it fester was good. Leaving the collar was stupid. Well known fact, ghosts don't leave things lying around.",8,27

You want us to stop his breathing?,"Well, only until you can figure out why. After that it'd be irresponsible. You and I should talk.",7,18

No but. You're right about all of it.,"Well, then, I'll see you at the reunion.",8,8
"Okay, while you're killing him... I'll get the intubation kit.",I decided you're right. You're obviously in an impossible position. There's no point in me humiliating you.,10,17
Guy's faking. It's Munchausen's. You notice the EMT run sheet? Paramedic who brought him in is also named Martin Harris.,"Well. If the name was Attila Von Weinerschnitzel, I'd say you might be on to something.",20,16

I think he has a medical degree.,It directly affects my bottom line. You have less money to lend!,7,12
I'm trying to take responsibility!,And I'm trying to teach you that Everyone is out for theirs. You might as well keep yours.,5,18
And lend it to you? You have to control Everything. How come you're going around asking Everyone who you should fire?,I'm asking for input! I thought you would have admired the humility.,21,12
You like games because you can control them.,"God, I'm gonna put the record back on.",8,8
"You like what's interesting, nEver mind if it's real or good!",Wanna know why you offered that guy six grand?,11,9
"Life just happens, and that scares the hell out of you!",You think you can cure pain!,11,6
You think you can avoid pain!,"You think you're responsible for Every failure, Every! Patient's boring life, Every friend's screwed-up! !",6,15
You don't want to face it any more than my Patient does! Dying's easy. Living's hard!,That can't possibly be as poignant as it sounded.,16,9
"Uh, still can't find the drug source, but I don't think that's the pRoblem. The dimercaprol isn't working. And Quidd volunteers at a home for abandoned kids.",Why are you telling me this?,27,6
"This is a joke, right?","It's only a joke if you come up with the answer. It's not really funny if you don't. ""Thirteen"" and Kutner, you're fired too. Foreman!",5,25
He's a druggie. I was nEver sure there was a disease in the first place.,So all we know is that he's dying. Who wants to tell the Patient?,15,14
So all we know is that he's dying. Who wants to tell the Patient?,Fine. We'll get some kid to go talk to him. It's the only people he gets along with anyway.,14,19
You could have just told me.,I want you to feel guilty. She thinks the Patient's a loser. She thinks the Patient's a winner. Just a regular guy with a regular pRoblem. He thinks he's gonna be great once he's all growed up. And he thinks! what did you think?,6,44
We can't all be right.,You're all wrong. My mom always said that two wrongs don't make a right. She nEver said anything about four wrongs. I always found that suspicious. Plain old measles. Constant exposure from hanging out with Oliver Twist and his lot.,5,40
I assume he's been vaccinated.,Patient's immune system was shredded with years of drugs. They're early markers of rash and fEver. Would have been lost in a druggie. His immune system overreacted. That's why his body went haywire.,5,33
You're not doing a biopsy without neurological symptoms.,"If I'm right, the virus is in his brain. Wrong course of treatment could be his last course.",8,18
He kept swallowing. Could be neurological. Could be a complex partial seizure.,What did it look like?,12,5
What did it look like?,"Good! God, Woman. How much more proof do you need?",5,10
"We're gonna use flashing lights. Noxious stimulation, it'll irritate your brain. If there's damage to your neurons, it'll trigger a seizure that we can!",I got something much more noxious.,24,6
I got something much more noxious.,"It's not as commonly used, but sound can be just as big an irritant.",6,14

"You didn't call me ""bitch"". Is that bad?",You play the game better than anybody else here.,8,9
You play the game better than anybody else here.,But for the wrong reasons.,9,5
Reasons don't matter. Results are the only thing!,"You were wrong. Twenty years ago, this was recorded by Jim Moskowitz. Who later became known as Jimmy Quidd. Loves kids, apparently has a heart, perhaps Even a soul. If you're gonna work for me, you have to be willing to be wrong, willing to lose. 'Cause you just did. You're fired.",8,52
What the hell did you do?,You told me to hire Kutner and Taub.,6,8
"Well, at least the games are over.",How long have you known me?,7,6
Tell him you're done firing people.,"Well if I lie, that would be little reassurance. Dr. Kutner, who told you that it would be a good idea to put up superficial representations of a hypocritical season celebrating a mythical figure?",6,34
Good. Then can we do a Secret Santa?,I liked you better fifteen seconds ago when you were afraid for your job. So who's sick?,8,17
Everyone lies but there's an exception to Every rule.,Actually there isn't. That's kinda what makes it a rule.,9,10
The Patient's mother died of breast cancer when she was sEven and she nEver Even knew her mom was sick. She promised herself she would nEver hide anything from her own daughter.,Oh! I didn't know she'd promised.,32,6
"She told her co-worker, she told her kid.",She lied to the world. Reconstructive surgery is designed to convince people that ,8,14

MRI what's left of her chest. Set the maParkne to scan for irony. I'm going to go redo the Patient history.,You mom tell you about all the drugs she does?,21,10
I don't do any of that stuff. It's bad for you.,"I understand why you don't want your mom to know, but I'm her doctor so ",11,16
Because she would nEver lie to me.,What's her favorite way to have sex?,7,7
I don't get what sex has to do with breast cancer.,Are you a doctor? Did you go to med school since the last time I asked?,11,16
"Oh, I thought that was our thumbs.",You wanna know Every place your mom's thumb has been?,7,10
"I'm sorry I missed rehearsal. Am I taking the ""truth is good"" side? Don't you usually take that part?","Lies are a tool, they can be used either for good! No wait, I got a better one. Lies are like Parkldren. Hard work, but they're worth it. Because the future depends on them.",19,34
You are so full of love! or something. When you care about someone ,You lie to them! You pretend that their constant ponderous musing are interesting. You tell them they're not losing their boyish good looks or becoming worn out.,14,27
"I stand corrected and may I say, it's been a real pleasure chatting with you. Sila's clean, surgical margins looks clear. No lymphadenopathy, no masses, no nothing. It's not cancer.",We need a new theory.,30,5
"Wouldn't ""no"" have been a shorter answer.",Wouldn't you not talking have made this a shorter conversation? Kid says mom's a slut.,7,15
She called her mom a slut?,"No, I called her mom a slut. Jumps anything with a pole and a pulse. Not that I'm judging here. Given her medical history, I'm actually impressed.",6,27
"Maggie already admitted to having multiple sexual partners. Which is why we already tested for, and ruled out, syphilis and any other STDs that could have caused her symptoms.",STDs aren't the only risk in risky sex. PRoblem in sleeping with strangers is! they're strange.,29,16
We'll follow up with any recent partners.,"Send Foreman and Taub. They're better liars, more likely to get to the truth.",7,14
Hmm! Must have been pretty hardworking.,Or just a credit hog.,6,5
You owe me 50 bucks.,Then you owe me half a lapdance.,5,7
It's for the nurses' holiday bonus. I know you got the memo.,Got the memo last year. I want to hire forty more fellows.,12,12
You already fired the ones you hired?,They work better when they're scared.,7,6
No. Kutner's starting the Patient on hemodialysis and Thirteen's in the lab trying to figure out what the guy put in the drugs.,"See? Clear, simple statement of facts describing their cooperation, with absolutely no attitude or fear.",23,15

"Do you spell ""homie"" with a Y?",I want to be respectful.,7,5
You're actually going to let us do Secret Santa?,Not just you guys. I like presents too. Pick a name.,9,11
Why are you doing this?,"See, this is why no one likes your people.",5,9
"See, this is why no one likes your people.","The notion of picking one time of the year to be decent to other people is obscene, because it's actually validating the notion of being miserable wretches the rest of the year.",9,32
So you think this is the part of the year they screwed up?,"On the other hand, you are now a team. Gotta work together and the simple fact is, giving people crap makes people like people so spend 25 bucks. Learn to love!",13,31
The dialysate composition just indiCates ,IndiCates nothing. I was referring to his reaction to the name he got.,6,13
I was pleased. I thought it'd be fun to buy for ,"Means! there's someone here who wouldn't be fun to buy for. I wonder who. Pick a name, then go check out the Patient's House.",12,24
We're wasting time going to the home. Kearns-Sayer syndrome fits the symptoms. takes a name from the stocking and tucks it into his jacket's inner pocket without Even looking.,No family history of Kearns. Go to their House ,29,10
"They would have told us if there were any other drugs. You met her, she couldn't have been more candid.",You're absolutely right. Go to their House ,20,8
MS or a vascular pRoblem fits better. They could affect hands and eyes.,"Fine. Do an MRI, check for MS. And a fluorescein angiogram of her eyes to see if we missed a bleed somewhere.",13,22
"Fine. Do an MRI, check for MS. And a fluorescein angiogram of her eyes to see if we missed a bleed somewhere.",Oh! And whoEver goes to their House! get me their computers.,22,11
Oh! And whoEver goes to their House! get me their computers.,You talk to your kid about sex so she'll think you're being open about Everything. Keeps her from asking questions about the things you don't want to talk about.,11,29
That's right. Her honesty proves just how dishonest she is.,Yes! Exactly who I wanted. This is going to be fun.,10,11
What's with the Secret Santa? You trying to bring them together?,I want to drive them apart.,11,6
"Aside from the Trojan horse, gifts don't usually ",What did you get your wife for your final anniversary?,9,10
I! gave her some cash and!,Gifts allow us to demonstrate exactly how little we know about a person and nothing pisses off a person more than being shoved in the wrong pigeon hole.,6,28
"Fluorescein angiogram was clear. No leaks, no lesions, definitely not a vascular pRoblem.",Someone get their birthdays out of the file.,13,8
Except she can't see out of them.,So she says. Find anything on the MRI?,7,8
Her brain is. What if it's a conversion disorder?,Lacks personal boundaries! Promiscuous! Inappropriate obsession with truth-telling! Certainly sounds like a psych case.,9,14
Then this serves no medical purpose.,"You have a genetic defect, you choose to ignore it. This Woman has a genetic defect, chooses to butcher herself to be safe. Yet what you claim to be fascinated by, is her honesty. Interesting.",6,35
"You claim to want the truth, and then you screw with people who actually live by it. Pathetic.","Hey, I gave you credit for interesting.",18,7
"Hey, I gave you credit for interesting.",You're protecting her because you're jealous she did what you couldn't.,7,11
I'm not lying to her.,"Fine, keep your mouth shut. I still need you. If it doesn't work, you gotta hold the kid down until someone else finishes lying to mom.",5,26
"Fine, keep your mouth shut. I still need you. If it doesn't work, you gotta hold the kid down until someone else finishes lying to mom.",That does actually serve a medical purpose.,26,7
I have to lie because she trusts me?,"If you show doubt, the placebo treatment won't work.",8,9
"If it's just depression, that's good news right?",A lot of great medications.,8,5
So why can't we just give her those? Why do we have to lie to her?,"Because we might be wrong. And those medications take a long time to work and since your mom's condition is declining, there's a chance the drugs won't tell us anything until it's too late.",16,34
My mom's nEver lied to me.,You don't know how to lie. You don't know how to tell when you're being lied to.,6,17
You gave them all your name?,Mm-hmm. Figured I could sow some dissension and get a few ties and sweaters.,6,14
What happens when they find out?,They'll argue about what to do with that information. Ties are less important than the dissension.,6,16

I was thinking... go from the neck and work my way down.,"Well, you could. But I'd nEver forgive myself if we found something before we got to your breasts.",12,18
I'm starting with the anterior cervical nodes.,Turn your head. LoCate the SCM muscle.,7,7

"Okay, take a deep breath... and insert the needle into the node.","Come on, Cate. Let's get this over with.",12,8
"I have nEver heard you ask a Patient that question. You've nEver asked me that question, and you've seen me fall down a flight of stairs drunk. You've slept with her.","She's 9,000 miles away. And while a certain part of me unfurled!",31,12
"No, you! Somehow you've been intimate with her. Why are you following me?",Thought you were following me.,13,5
"Call off your dogs, House. Your little helpers are interrogating my Patients, swiping my charts, intercepting prescriptions.",Why would you think that I'm!,17,6
Because I'm not a moron. You had to be pulling the strings here. You think that because they make me miserable I'm going to give you cable?,Let's assume that's true. And it certainly sounds like it might be. What are you going to do?,27,18
Free Rottweiler puppies. Please call after 11:00 pm and before 5:00 am. Is this Cameron's home number?,"I love a new puppy. My last one was delicious, very tender.",17,12
There's no point in torturing her.,"If she can resign, she can un-resign. Go to def-con one. Forget waiting for a mistake, make her make one.",6,20
"If she can resign, she can un-resign. Go to def-con one. Forget waiting for a mistake, make her make one.","Harm suggests perManent damage. Get her to screw up, then fix it. Oh, and this time, don't tell her what you're going to do before you do it.",20,28
"No, I hope it's something, It's maybe Oh, no! I'm screwed.",Bad news is you're 0 for 2 in the kidney department.,11,11
Is there good news? You're back at home.,Of course. There's cable. And the freedom to work pant-free.,8,10
"Autoimmune is just your latest theory. Like cancer before that, and a kidney stone before.","Take the prednisone, you'll get better, that'll be your confirmation.",15,10
"You practice medicine like it's a fire sale. You've wasted antibiotics, X-rays.",That was not a waste. We ruled out!,12,8
"We have a crew member here who has asthma. If he has an episode after I've used up the prednisone, he'll die.","There a good chance he's going to die anyway, since there won't be a doctor there to help him.",22,19
We should send her outside.,"Right, just tell her to head north until she runs into a hospital.",5,13
She'd only need to be outside five minutes.,Without her mittens. Mom told me that was a bad idea. Especially that winter it was 70 below and I had dual kidney failure.,8,24
"You didn't touch the cash, but you took the receipts?","190 restaurant tab. That's dessert, pRobably booze. Means you lingered. Means it's at least the third date. Means!",10,18
"There are no ideas. The test for autoimmune is ANA. Unless penguins poop immuno-analysers, she's not!","Before A.N.A. testing, people had autoimmune diseases. How did they know?",16,11

"And yet you keep hanging out with him. And from what I hear, you have spent more time with me than with any other Patient.",Sorry about that. Call me when you get the results.,25,10
"Taub caught the error in time. If she'd just admitted the mistake, maybe I could've just suspended her. But... she's packing up, if you want to say good-bye.",We should be hearing from the South Pole in a few minutes.,28,12
I got to go talk to Cameron.,"Cuddy wouldn't can her for one screw-up and if she did, she wouldn't come to me. And if she did, she wouldn't open with, ""how's your Patient."" And if she did...",7,31
LE Prep test was negative. It's not autoimmune.,You're basing that on a test done with a paperclip. Just take the prednisone.,8,14
Either find another diagnosis or find another test.,There is one way. You can take this experimental drug called... pred-ni-sone! Your Kidneys start working...,8,16
"If I go outside, we'll have our answer? And you knew about this?","I rejected it because if you're frozen solid, it's hard to get the needles into your arms.",13,17
"Took the station mechanic 20 minutes to respond. She'd already slipped into a coma. Started her on prednisone, but no improvement.","Means it's not autoimmune. Good thing she's in a coma, or we'd have to listen to her gloat.",21,18
And where are we going?,To find the useful members of my team.,5,8
You're letting them off the hook?,"Happy? Because of you, I'm not going to be able to watch law and order in Korean.",6,17
She doesn't have a name. It's some sort of birth defect.,"There's only about 12 people we both know. I can't remember five of their names, so we're down to... Cuddy! Your ex-wives...",11,22
Your mama. You need to run a kidney function test.,"Yes, if only she wasn't in a coma, we could get her to run a test to find out why she's in a coma. The results would likely be paradoxical. Can't be Cuddy, 'cause you're straight. Can't be!",10,38
We could talk the mechanic through the test.,Too compliCated... Unless he's thirsty.,8,5
Take a straight catheter and insert it...,"These are your only questions? Not, is it safe? Or, is there another way? Or, are you out of your minds?",7,21
You wouldn't ask me if!,"Wait a second. You're in love with her. That explains why you're so eager to get her naked, then have a drink. Cause most guys like to go the other way around.",5,32
Why do you care how I feel about her?,"Because now, I know that I can get you to do anything to save her. Tell him how to tap the keg.",9,22
Cuddy wasn't supposed to find out.,No kidding! Get me cable. How tough can that be? Cost a Woman her job. There's only one thing you can say to keep me from firing you.,6,28
How do you figure out which one it is?,"We don't do anything. You're going to drill a hole in her skull. If she regains consciousness, it's increased intracranial pressure.",9,21
And if it's the other thing?,"She'll die. But if it's the hypothalamus, she's dead anyway.",6,10
"If the pRoblem is the pressure in her brain, and I fix it, is she going to be all better?","Nope, but it'll give us more time to figure out what's wrong.",20,12
I have to get someone else. I can't do this.,"You love her, right? You'd do anything to save her.",10,10
"Not this. I can't do this. If, if she dies because of something that I did, then I!","Listen, listen. I am not going to let you hurt her. Okay? Now please... This is her only chance.",18,19
"Bone's harder than wood, lean into it. The skull's only a quarter-inch thick. Once you're midway through, drill in shorter bursts.","If it comes out the other side, you've gone too far.",21,11

"What if the clots aren't clots? Atherosclerosis. Fatty plaque builds up on the arterial walls, pieces break off, block blood flow. Explains Everything.","She has zero risk factors. Forget fat, think clots.",23,9
"Could be a different kind of fat, fat emboli.","That's a perfect fit... Except it's completely impossible! Fat emboli requires an unrepaired bone break. Between the x-ray and the exam, I've seen her entire! See, that's what I'm talking about.",9,31

"Better leave, if you see her, it'll be cheating.",It's not one of your ex-wives.,9,6
Did you Ever consider being happy for me?,Briefly. You ordering the wine before she got here!,8,9
"Girls are good, House. And you know it. You solved your case because you cared about that girl.",You're demonstrating the illusion of Manly confidence. Which means you haven't closed the deal yet.,18,15
"You knew your Patient hated having cold feet because you did a physical exam, because you liked her.","Your theory is I cared, therefore I let her keep her socks on? If that's what love is, then I don't want to have anything to do with it.",18,29
It starts with warm feet but leads to other things. Your mom and I will explain when you're older.,"If I'd made her take them off like I should've, I would've seen the toe and would've solved the case days ago.",19,22
I know you chose well for me. I've been blessed.,Cross-species mating. I feel like Darwin in the Galapagos.,10,9

Low sodium could also be from low food. Hasidic Jews fast on their wedding day.,Or... sodium was absorbed by a toxin already in her system. Was it just the legs? Or did you detect something resembling a soul?,15,24

Just because he didn't salute doesn't mean he can't.,And can you find out where that voice keeps coming from? And tell it to get out of my head.,9,20

I did it because it was the right thing to do.,You did it to pass an inspection.,11,7
Does it matter? Kidney failure on top of the other symptoms points to an autoimmune condition which means that any of his other organs could be next. We've already started dialysis. We need to run ANAs for autoimmune.,"You're right. You and the team, go measure the ceilings.",38,10

Wilson is done talking now. Visualize the bus. The way it looked. The way it smelled. The people on it. What they look like.,This is a waste of... Time. Cool.,24,7

What are you running away from?,"When I'm drinking without you? What am I running away from? Hmm, One of those imponderables. Can you hold off on your insecurities until we find this Patient?",6,28
Do you see anyone in the bar?,I see a faceless crowd. How do I focus? Say something to make me focus.,7,15
He's concerned about you. Why does that mean he's insecure?,Will you get your girlfriend out of here?,10,8
Amber's there? You've got Amber in your head?,You put her in my head. I can't Even have a conversation with you in my subconscious without her tagging along.,8,21
Well she better have her clothes on.,Unfortunately. I didn't mean to say that out loud.,7,9
What's going on in there?,"If I can't lie, I need these two out of here.",5,11
"Let's just ignore Wilson and Amber for now, shall we?","I wish it were that "" That's some program they got down there in Melbourne. Cheers. I remember the Bartender.",10,20
Good. Now you're accessing your temporal lobe. Does the Bartender have any odd symptoms?,He seems fine. Anybody here sick? Anyone here taking the bus?,14,11
"You're focusing on him, why?",Because nose picking could mean nasal pruritus. He's dying.,5,9
Do I have to answer?,"If the answer was no, you would have answered. Tilt your head back.",5,13
"He's fine. He doesn't Even have meningitis, just like Everybody else we've had to give meningitis shots to. You can go.",You have a brain tumour.,21,5

Your legs are not your biggest pRoblem. Your biggest pRoblem is... I don't know what your biggest pRoblem is.,"So, we have the who, but not the what.",19,9
We've only got one symptom to go on. Sudden onset paralysis.,We actually have two symptoms.,11,5
You can't just eliminate Everything because it doesn't match what you might have seen.,How about because it doesn't match what I could have seen? Guillain-Barr has no external physical Manifestations.,14,17
Why are you smelling the passengers' clothes?,Smell is the most powerful evokerater of memory. I need to get back on that bus.,7,16
Okay. So why are you taking so much Vicodin?,"If Cuddy asks, blocking the pain helps focus the memory.",9,10
"You split your head open, you should rest. Anything?",A hint of... Exploded bus.,9,5
"House, that's four Vicodin in forty seconds. At this rate...",Wish me luck. I'm going in. Rambo style.,10,8
You're wrong. It's not working.,"So, you're saying I'm not here.",5,6
"If this were a real memory, you'd be limping. And you wouldn't be talking to me. I'm obviously a hallucination.",Okay. So I went a little heavy on the Vicodin.,20,10
Okay. So I went a little heavy on the Vicodin.,We're both in my head. You'd think one of us would have noticed the blood.,10,15
Why haven't you had a head CT yet?,Who do you want me to treat? Me or you? Did you have a seizure?,8,15
Dumb question. The brain's too fried during a seizure to form memories.,"Dumb answer. I wasn't asking you, I was asking me. Because you've already proven that you're not here.",12,18
He can't. The hallucination is your messed up brain's way of reasoning out a pRoblem.,You weren't on the bus.,15,5
Must be another reason why I'm here.,Yes. What do you have to tell me? I was talking to the passengers on the bus!,7,17

This isn't just a boo-boo.,I'll rest once I've figured out what's wrong with this guy.,5,11
Rapid onset. It could be a perforated ulcer.,"Wouldn't explain the paralysis. Addison's, from a tumour. It's possible that I saw his eyelids droop.",8,16
We've scanned his head five times. You're bleeding.,A little thing called a bus crash. It's just a scalp laceration. It could be hidden in his optic Parkasm.,8,20
It's coming from your ear. You think that's a good thing?,But that would have affected his eyesight. I need to take a bath.,11,13
"Hallucinations and smells were kind of working, right? Why the bath?",Hypnosis gave me a nose picker. Smells set off hallucinations. Sensory deprivation should get the brain into an alpha-theta phase. Didn't you see Altered States?,11,25
I don't think I was Even born when that movie was out.,Well then you're too young to be a doctor. That movie was released in 1980.,12,15
That was twenty-eight years ago.,"No, it wasn't, shut up.",5,5
Did you just forget what year it is?,No. I just remembered how old I am. I need to give my brain time to transition so I can embrace my inner monkey. Or maybe I don't. Give me some physostigmine. It crosses the blood-brain barrier.,8,37
"And act like a nerve gas, stop your heart, you'll go to heaven and be omniscient. Good idea. Not going to happen.","Don't do anything. Even if I escape. Eat a goat. Get shot by police """,22,15
I didn't know you rode the bus.,"I used to drive home after getting drunk, but some mothers got MAD-D. What are you doing here? You weren't on the bus with me.",7,25

"You're convinced your Patient is dying, and you want to waste your time with a sex fantasy?",Don't blame me. Blame my gender.,17,6

"Your Patient was driving the bus, so all you could see was him sitting down. Most likely facing forward.","From behind, I saw his earlobes wiggling. Or his head bobbing. But not that.",19,14
It's not fatal in adults.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's an adult, very good point. Keep going.",5,11
"Hey, over here. Remember me? I'm the sick guy.",Tell me what I saw.,9,5
Was it the blood dripping from my ear?,That doesn't make sense. Because your shirt wasn't stained. And because that was me.,8,14
"I could have had a subtle hemiballismus, indicating the early stages of Huntington's.",Huntington's wouldn't explain the abdominal pain. And it's only on the table because we're thinking of Thirteen.,13,17

Verbal faculties seem to be intact. Do you remember passing out?,I remember puking on Cuddy's shoes. Ow.,11,7
Yeah. Skull fractures tend to hurt.,It'd hurt a lot less if you didn't swipe my pain pills.,6,12

"Thank you. But Wilson's wouldn't explain "" Foreman.",How did you eliminate Parkinson's?,8,5
"Well, the tests confirmed the abdominal pain was caused by liver failure.",I assume you've already ruled out hepatitis and Wilson's.,12,9
Give him five minutes. Brainstorming a few possibilities isn't going to explode his brain.,"Then if she's wrong, that makes this phone call that much more exciting. What about hepatic fibrosis?",14,17
It could be thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.,Did I mention this diagnosis needs to make sense?,6,9
"Why doesn't it make sense? The bus driver's Asian, his potassium is slightly low ""","If he got paralysed while driving the bus, don't you think I would have gotten off at the next stop?",15,20
Not if the next stop was at a 90 degree angle into an SUV.,"The bus would have slowed, I would have noticed """,14,10
TPP has all the confirmed symptoms. There's no downside to testing.,Genetic test is too slow. Run the bagel test!,11,9
I told you not to lock the door.,Still wiping! Put the phone up to bus driver's grill.,8,10
Who are you talking to?,My large colon. TPP is not consistent with your Patient's laboured breathing.,5,12
Did you take my cell phone?,My large colon did. I'm negotiating its release.,6,8
The test worked. He collapsed.,"You're half right. He's wheezing, isn't he?",5,7
It must be a pulmonary embolism.,So why haven't you pushed a vial of tPA?,6,9
I asked him back in.,At the tail end of me Patiently explaining how you idiots were idiots.,5,13
We pushed tPA ten minutes ago.,That means it's not a clot.,6,6
Get him to the OR to suck it out.,Must have just screwed up the intubation. Seal's good.,9,9
I didn't bring you back here so you could stage a coup!,"Listen to me. Dental air drill pushed an air bubble into his gums. Dislodged while he was driving, and caused a myoclonic jerk. That's what I must have seen. Then it hit his spine, his liver, and now his lungs.",12,40

The O2 sats. There was an air bubble. He's okay.,The other nurse always used to tuck me in.,10,9
In the ointment. So there's something wrong. There's some detail I'm not noticing that's spoiling the big picture.,Is this significant? Or is this dream just going in a different direction now?,18,14
I guess that depends. What are you going to do with that?,I have to tie this around you.,12,7
It's not over. I saved the wrong person.,"This wasn't just a dream or a fantasy, or a drug-induced trip to Wonderland.",8,14
So the bus driver with the air bubble was just a coincidence?,Nope. I got the causation flipped. The bubble didn't cause the crash. The crash caused the bubble to dislodge. There was no myoclonic jerk. I saw something else in someone else.,12,31
"Elevated heart rate, BP... Which is exactly why you need to stop.","Instead of sleeping, I'm going to be pacing around this apartment trying to decipher those visions.",12,16

Maybe I don't need the actual victims.,"Who's playing Anne McKeehan? Right here. Jane Doe 2 from Princeton General. Right here. You two, that's right. Goth kid. Yeah. At the back on the right. Yeah. Here. Okay...",7,30
You think that staring at pictures on our shirts is going to be more effective than hypnosis?,"Well, if only you'd stop talking, the re-enactment could stimulate activity in my hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex.",17,17
Are you crazy? Alzheimer's drugs will make your brain go into overdrive.,That's the point. It'll speed up my neuronal firing. Turn up the voltage on my memory.,12,16
And blow out your heart. How Many did you take?,Just now? Or including the ones I took on the ride over?,10,12
You beliEve in reason above all else. There must be a reason.,You have something to tell me.,12,6
You know who I am.,"If I did, I'd be passed out in bed instead of OD'ing on physostigmine on the 6th Street cross-town.",5,19

"You almost kill yourself, and all we're getting is drug-induced fantasies.",Have you spoken to her?,11,5

Female. Late twenties. Kidney damage. Does Amber have a birthmark on her right shoulder blade?,She was on the bus with me. She's the one who's dying.,15,12
I don't know how I got here. I saw a symptom before the crash.,Why was I taking the bus?,14,6
Taxing an already injured brain.,Someone is dying because I can't remember.,5,7

Three critical Patients ahead of her. We'll have her in within the hour.,We're fifteen minutes away from Princeton Plainsboro by ambulance.,13,9
You wanna move her? Her heart rate is a hundred and thirty.,She's hemodynamically stable. We're moving her.,12,6
Why was she on the bus?,"I don't know. If she had any underlying condition, the accident could have exacerbated it.",6,15

"Wait, wait, wait! Protective hypothermia.",You wanna freeze her? Her heart's not beating.,5,8
"Her heart's already damaged. If you restart it, it'll keep racing, shoot off free radicals, and kill her brain. We ice her down, put her on bypass until you've diagnosed her.",This is not a solution. All you're doing is pressing pause.,31,11
Why are we doing this?,Bought us time to think.,5,5
Bought us time to think.,The trauma must have stimulated a pre-existing heart condition.,5,9
"Autoimmune congenital anomaly, blood clotting disorder, lead poisoning...","Great! Let's explore that. Quick, get her on panacea.",8,9
"EKG, nope. Heart's in the off position. Thallium uptake scan? Useless on a cold heart.","Yeah, we get it. Her heart's not beating. It's gonna make it harder to diagnose. On the other hand, she's not gonna die while you're whining about it. What else?",15,30
Why not cyanide? He's a mess. He needs to sleep.,"I had a heart attack this morning. Can't do any more drugs till lunch. Get her an angiogram. Could show damage Even in a stopped heart. Rest of you search her apartment. Toxins, heavy metals, drugs, anything that might make her heart race.",10,43

You were obviously drinking last night. Maybe you took Amber to a bar.,I left here on my motorcycle alone.,13,7
You ended up drunk on a bus together. Maybe you met Amber in the bar.,I was not having an affair with her.,15,8
You can't really say that if you don't remember.,"I lost four hours, not four months.",9,7
"Don't worry, you're just dreaming.",What symptom did I see in you? A myoclonic jerk...,5,10
What did we do last night?,Was I meeting you for a drink?,6,7
You need to rest. I have yet to hear about any study linking electricity and rest.,Deep brain stimulation. It's been proven. Electrical impulses applied directly to the hypothalamus could evoke detailed memories.,16,17
It's gonna be okay. I'm here with you.,The team has found something. Can you ask her if we can be excused?,8,14
Sh-she'd have to be an addict to take enough for it to damage her heart. I'd know.,Did you know that she was hiding them in her vitamins?,17,11
"No, we've been over this. Starting her heart could cause brain damage, could burn out the heart muscle.","Test her heart without starting it. Crack her chest open, reach a finger inside the pulmonary vein, run it across the valve.",18,22

"And the cardio fits just as well. But there's no way we can tell, since we can't take her temperature.","I had a dream. She was pouring me a glass. And since I'm a scotch-, beer-, gin-, and rum-Man...",20,19
Amber doesn't Even drink sherry. House. Can we get back...?,"If she did drink sherry, it would mean nothing. Since she doesn't, my subconscious is obviously trying to make some other point.",10,22
"A coaster with ""Sharrie's Bar "". A glass of scotch is placed on it, by the Bartender.",Wilson's right. We need to make her colder.,17,8
Putting more ice on her is just delaying the diagnosis.,"Not on, in. Fill in her lungs with slurry.",10,9
She sneezed. I gave her a napkin.,Did you see the color of the sputum?,7,8
"I assume sputum means snot. Look, I see a lot of drunk Parkcks in here. I didn't have time to stop and analyze the color of your girlfriend's boogers.","She's not my girlfriend, genius.",29,5

We're about to start a second course of interferon.,Which she might not need once you turn her over. Small of her back.,9,14
A rash. How'd you know what was on the small of her back?,"Either I'm still asleep, or I'm starting to remember.",13,9
Wouldn't speed up her heart.,"Yes, the symptom that I saw on the bus was a rare interferon allergy that flares up two days before you take it.",5,23
How did you see the rash down there?,I don't know. Maybe she leaned over.,8,7

Not Everything. Before you warm her up... You said you wanted to try deep brain stimulation.,"But there's no reason. We know the symptom, we know what I saw.",16,13
What if it's not the rash? What if you noticed the rash in the ambulance or when we were putting her on bypass? What if there is still something else stuck inside your head?,You think I should risk my life to save Amber's.,34,10
Who was talking? Is Amber there?,"You're supposed to be jolting my hypothalamus, not petting it.",6,10
We don't want to overload it.,"As long as I'm risking my life, I might as well be watParkng a talkie.",6,15

I thought you said you needed 8 weeks of rehab. You should have been back here,"If I'd come back sooner, I'd only be able to run 6 miles. I nEver would have made it in. What have you got for me?",16,26
You're completely pain free? The ketamine treatment can wear off.,It's been 2 months. It's not wearing off. What have you got for me?,10,14
It can take as long as--,"Why are we having this discussion? Want to hear me thank you again? Thank you Dr Cuddy. Not just for removing the bullet, but thank you for putting me in a ketamine-induced coma and changing my life. Happy? I am.",6,40

Uhh... you could take a whole 2 minutes to ease into being back.,"Taken a whole month to ease back, 8 weeks is the maximum rehab time for a gunshot wound to the stomach and neck. So, go.",13,25
We heard they nEver found the guy. There's no new leads?,What? You think he might have shot this Patient too? Would explain her symptoms!,11,14
See? It's not so difficult.,"It's not MS. She had no symptoms before she climbed on to her head. Unless she's been upside-down for the last 10 years, MS ain't it.",5,26
The leg looks fine. You totally pain free?,When did this turn into 'what did you do over your summer vacation'?,8,13
I asked Cuddy to replace the carpet.,"No, I like the carpet. What did you do over the summer?",7,12
You don't think that's from the pool he drank?,"Give him an O2 mask. His leg muscles have atrophied, tendons have shortened from disuse causing intense pain. Tendon surgery will make him more comfortable.",9,25

"Ok, this is Dr. House. House, this is Caren--","Pleasure's all mine, what happened?",9,5
"When we inserted the conduction pin, she flinched.",She flinched! Did you hear?,8,5

I know it's hypocritical but--,"Not at all, the world sees your legs, no one's checking out your lungs.",5,14

So--",11,62
We should give her a local.,That would defeat the point of me being nasty. Ready? Down.,6,11

"No, I mean all the other doctors, all they did was obsess on the... the cancer, the treatment, the damage... just trying to fix him. You're the first doctor that's Ever given a damn about the quality of his life.","His heart rate's come down, the morphine worked I was right.",40,11
What a touParkng moment. That's why we become doctors. For those rare moments when our hearts are warm--,Would you like to get a drink?,18,7
Are you serious or are you just trying to change the subject?,"No, I'm serious. I drink, you drink. We could do it at the same time, same table. Do you eat? We could do that too. I mean, if the answer's no that's cool but...",12,34
"No, I... it's just... you're just coming off the surgery and you're not yourself yet and I work for you and Even though last year's... you're smiling! I'm saying no and you're smiling!","Oh, don't take it personally. Its just coz you're full of crap. You have no interest in going out with me.

"There's no tumor. Her platelets are normal, scans--",What's the worst that can happen? I paralyze her. She won't Even notice.,8,13
Her Lawyers might. You're not doing the surgery. And lower the morphine on your other Patient.,"Fine, I'll lower it. If you'll let me do the surgery.",16,11
What? You want a trade? We're not swapping a couple of goats for your help putting up a barn.,"You want something, I want something. We compromise. It's the grown-up way to resolve our differences.",19,16

The fifth lEvel of happiness involves creation. Changing lives.,Sixth lEvel is heroin; sEventh lEvel is you going away.,9,10
The room's no longer sterile.,"True, it's not the most interesting reason. That is not a sexy big toe. You'd nEver put that in your mouth.",5,21
What the hell has that got to do with--,Told you it was interesting; it gets Even better.,9,9
"The uh... nurse changed his morphine, I thought you were worried about--",It's just post-op discomfort. He's ready to go home.,12,9
"Well, you took away his pain and that, that changes a lot.",Why don't you put him in some sort of... facility? Some place without a pool.,12,15
"Yeah. I could dump him there, except he's my husband. He's my son's father.",Right. Kids need a dad; someone to play catch with. Talk about girls.,14,13
I'm taking care of him for the same reason you helped us.,Some guy shot you and you hallucinated?,12,7
"Yoga girl walked out of here 2 hours ago, you fixed her.","Not her, the other guy.",12,5
He had brain cancer; they removed it 8 years ago. His condition's been the same Ever since.,"Until last night, he spoke.",17,5
You want us to dissect 8 years of medical history with grunting in the differential?,Sounds good. Call me when you're done.,15,7
You're fabricating a mystery because you're bored.,I am not bored. Damn it.,7,6
You didn't tell the wife it was only a grunt?,"Of course not, because then she would nEver have consented to a bunch of dangerous tests. I don't remember you being this bitchy.",10,23
"The Vicodin dulled it, in the sober light of day I'm a buzz kill. You're giving false hope to a family that's been wrecked. Don't torture them, let it go, tell the wife it was only a grunt, tell her to go home.","Can't let her down like that, pumped her up with too much false hope. Oh! I stuck that primo! How rad am I?",43,23
"No, creatinine and BUN were both normal.","Not the kidney part, the pain part. Abdominal pain plus all that stuff could equal a pancreatic cyst.",7,18
"Perfect, you Managed to pick the one symptom he nEver had. Abdominal pain.",It's the first symptom on the board. Grunt.,13,8
Grunting isn't pathognomonic for abdominal pain.,"No, traditional diagnostic marker is compression of the diaphragm, vibration of the larynx leading to the audible sound 'I have a pain in my abdomen'.",6,25
Richard's symptoms are culled from 8 years of medical history. They're not patterned. These are random individual Events over time.,Illnesses have incubation periods. Do an upper endoscopic ultrasound.,20,9

"Which means barring anything else, meaning you, he can go home tomorrow.",This Man nearly died. How can you discharge him?,12,9
"You stick something down someone's throat, they gag, spasm, which he did. It took us a half an hour to get that thing out.","Except that our Patient's throat was sedated. Which means the brain should have sent a signal not to do anything. This could be cancer, or some bizarre neuro-degeneration, Even a new type of vasculitis--",24,34
It's interesting only if you're right; if you're wrong we're torturing this guy to amuse you.,Half hour to remove the pRobe?,16,6
"There are no lesions on his brain, nothing to interrupt the new orders.",All it takes is one wire down.,13,7
You have no evidence of any wires down.,"A few micro-tumors on the meninges, suddenly you're choking to death.",8,11
Because that wouldn't be interesting. You can get permission this time.,The brain is enclosed in a sac called the meninges--,11,10
"So what, more surgery? More radiation?",Might not be the worst thing. If this isn't just ancient history then maybe it's something we can correct. Might Even get some brain function back.,6,26
You're lucky he didn't die.,I'm lucky? He's the one who didn't die.,5,8
We told you he'd hemorrhage.,"Told me he'd bleed into his brain, not out of his ear.",5,12
"We did a dangerous test and something bad happened, that's all this is.","Give me a tour of the brain, Foreman. Walk me through the scans. 1998, what happened?",13,16
5 cm grade 4 astrocytoma between the parietal--,"Nothing. Next, a speck on the superior temporal region.",8,9
"House Every speck is not a suspect, its years of surgeons digging around in his head. Let him go.",Re-do Every blood test he's Ever had. Re-scan his head.,19,10
"No. He's been sick and suffering for 8 years, I'm not going to help you make it worse; I'm not going to help you make it interesting.","That's ok, Foreman's better at that stuff than you are. We need 5mm cuts through the occipital and hypothalamic regions.",27,20
That's it? That's your argument?,Seems like a good one.,5,5
"If I thought for a second you wanted to help him, you'd have carte blanche. You're doing this because it's fun.",Does nobody in this hospital have anything better to talk about than my motives? My motives have nothing to do with the case.,21,23
Your motives have Everything to do with your judgment.,"For the first time in years I've got no opiates in my body, now you question my judgment.",9,18
"24 times a year you come storming into my office spouting that you can help someone. Only you nEver say those words, you say something like his pancreas is going to explode because his brain is on fire!

And you discovered this when you stepped into the university pool?,Fountain. I can cure him.,11,5
"Cure him? Even if the fountain proved anything, fixing hypothalamic dysregulation isn't going to regenerate brain.","No, but if the scar tissue on his hypothalamus is resting against the pituitary, the adrenals would shut down. Addison's disease.",16,21
His temperature's normal. There is nothing wrong with his hypothalamus or his pituitary!,I can make him walk! I can make him talk!,13,10
This is a wild guess! That came to you because you were! sweating.,"Inject him with cortisol. The guy will have sex with his wife again, he'll hug his kid again. Hopefully that's the combination he was using, it'd be a shame if I'd cured a pedophile. You're smiling, that's a bad sign.",13,40
This is as high as you get. A theory that ties your case up in a neat little bow but you don't have a lick of substantiating proof.,"Your decision doesn't make any sense. There is no risk to a cortisol injection. If I'm wrong, big deal. He goes home a vegetable like he already is, but if I'm right--",28,32
He's on his way out of here. Figure you'd be on your scooter racing down the halls to stab the Patient in the neck with cortisol.,She was right to say no. I had no objective reason to think that I was right. Just needed the puzzle.,26,21
And yet you're earlier than usual.,"Is this an intervention? It's a little late, since I'm not using drugs anymore. I am, howEver, still hooked on phonics.",6,21
If you still did your morning run and showered at home you'd be later than usual.,Thought of you in the shower.,16,6
How's your leg? You seem to be favoring your left side.,I was hanging down my right pant leg yesterday. Makes all the difference in the world.,11,16

"Kid is a product of an in vitro fertilization pregnancy. Had all his vaccinations, fractured his right ulna at age three, Parkcken pox at age five ""","He Ever get his feelings hurt? I'll need to know that, too.",27,12

"Well, I'm just not arrogant enough to think that of the 50 billion galaxies, 100 billion stars per galaxy, and 10 million billion planets in the universe that we're the only ones with life.",No. But I'm guessing we're the only ones who like shoving things through our back doors.,34,16
There is new research indicating a link between neurological pRoblems and bleeding disorders.,Perfect. Especially if there were neurological pRoblems.,13,7
"What part of ""hallucinating an alien abduction"" isn't neurological?","Well, why is that a hallucination?",9,6
"What? You think the kid ""","He's having nightmares. Nightmares aren't a symptom of anything, other than wanting to sleep with Mommy. Which just leaves us with one symptom: the bloody tuchas, which can easily be explained by a GI pRoblem or a bleeding disorder. Check his coags with PT, PTT, and bleeding time. And prep him for endoscopies from above and below.",6,57
"His alien abduction story! the lEvel of detail is... I don't know where he gets it from. The parents say he doesn't watch sci-fi, he doesn't read comic books """,Great! You do any of that medical stuff we talked about?,30,11
Upper and lower endoscopies were clean.,So it's a simple bleeding disorder.,6,6
"No, blood tests were all normal. And he clotted in six minutes.",So it's a simple bleeding disorder and you screwed up the test.,12,12
I didn't screw up the test!,"So it's a UFO, unidentified flowing orifice. Either you screwed up the test, or I screwed up my analysis of this case. If you screwed up, I don't have to cry myself to sleep. It's a simple bleeding disorder. Foreman, redo the test.",6,43
Had to stop the bleeding myself after 25 minutes.,So you're saying Chase did screw up.,9,7
Big hand points to minutes. Maybe you got them mixed up?,"Oh, snap! Foreman's playing the dozens; you're at a cultural disadvantage here. Take a few minutes to think up a witty retort.",11,22
So we have contradicting bleeding time tests. If we run labs to check his clotting factors we can confirm which one's right.,"Yeah, testing, nice idea. Way better than trying to guess which doctor's incompetent. Much better than the paperwork, too.",22,19
"Clancy, stop! There is no Parkp! We're going to clean you up, and we're going to go back to your room. You can't do things like this. Your parents!",Results came back. The lab cannot identify the metal. They said it might not Even be terrestrial.,29,17
"That pin was removed six months after ""","So what, a little piece broke off during removal.",8,9
"Titanium is used to build nuclear subs, pieces don't just break off.",Tell that to the guys on the Kursk.,12,8
"To his lungs, maybe. Not his neck.",Yeah. An alien Parkp makes more sense. The real mystery is you didn't actually screw up.,7,16
He clotted on his own?,"Sure did. So first there was no bleeding disorder, then there was, now there's not again.",5,16
Or Foreman screwed up. Two out of three tests agree with my findings.,"Lucky for us, the fourth test will be the charm.",13,10
"He's in ICU, systolic is hovering around 170, I left instructions to lower it slowly so we don't risk hypoperfusing his organs.","Tradeoff being that leaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke, MI, and blindness.",22,14
Right. Kids always cheat on their bleeding time tests.,"She was being metaphorical. Trying to sound like me. I have no idea what you meant, but I could smell what the Rock was cooking.",9,25
"I meant, he's clotting right now and he's in hypertensive crisis. Maybe the two are related. What if he was hypertensive the other two times that he clotted?",Hypertensive crisis can activate clotting factors. Even someone low on von Willenbrand's could theoretically clot.,28,15
And the first time Clancy clotted he was all worked up recounting his alien abduction; he could have easily have been hypertensive.,I know I get worked up when I cut microParkp tracking implants out of my neck.,22,16
Sounds like a cheat to me.,"Yeah, we get it. Okay, what's the differential for a sEven-year-old boy suffering multiple hypertensive crises?",6,16
"It's clean, his heart isn't the pRoblem.",Why don't I have hi-def in my office? I'm a department head!,7,12
Tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of Legos.,"See, this is what I'm talking about. Foreman, you've got to steal this thing for me.",12,16
"The clearer the image, the clearer it is that there are no masses, no clots, no tears. The pRoblem's got to be somewhere else.",We're gonna need a bigger boat.,24,6
We don't have a laser pointer.,"Well, why not? Who's going to take us seriously if we don't have a laser pointer? Right here! A few thousand myocytes not beating with the rest.",6,27
So you found an arrhythmia.,"That's not an arrhythmia, that's a no-rhythmia. Myocytes contract, these aren't moving at all. Go get me those myocytes; I want to talk to them in my office.",5,28
What's going on with the leg?,"First, tell me what's going on with the boobs.",6,9
"As long as there's no increased activity in the thalamus """,Looks to me like those puppies are going into the dairy business.,11,12
"-- Then the pain can be good. It could be muscle regenerating. After you work out, you get sore. Pain doesn't mean the ketamine failed.",Guess I should be saying 'mazel tov.' Who gets to pass out the cigars?,25,14
I'm not pregnant. I need to get a PET scan of your brain.,Boy or girl? You got a name picked out?,13,9
"Here's Clancy's DNA, and here's the DNA from the piece of that heart we just biopsied.",That is impossible. Run it again.,16,6
There are ways DNA could become mutated. Extreme UV radiation.,"That much sun, he'd be dying with a healthy bronze glow.",10,11
Nitrous acid or ethidium bromide exposure.,"So first Daddy was a rapist, now he's a chemist.",6,10
Various species of fungus have been proven mutagenic.,"Not unless the kid's been eating barrels of celery or living in Indonesia, or both.",8,15
What if we find the heart cells with the bad DNA and we tag them?,Can you phrase that in the form of a metaphor?,15,10
I want you to run.,When did you become an enabler?,5,6
"I'm enabling you to exercise. Vicodin blocks the pain, you get through your rehab, muscle strength increases, and pain decreases.",I'd rather not become dependant on pain pills to get through my day.,20,13
"You're just like any other Patient "" running away from knowledge that won't make you happy.",I'm as happy as a pig in poop.,16,8
You're scared the ketamine treatment's wearing off. That it was just a tortuous window of the good life.,What part of poop didn't you understand?,18,7
How can you be so sure it isn't just a sore muscle?,It's my leg. We've known each other a long time.,12,10
We didn't miss anything. Brain scan was completely clean.,Our tag must not have penetrated the blood-brain barrier. Don't use an IV this time; get it right into the brain.,9,21
"His scan was clean, twice! It's not there!","What if it is there but didn't show up on the scan? What if the tag just doesn't work in his brain? Brain cells are structurally different, express a different protein.",8,31
"We don't know that we fixed anything, it's only been a day. Maybe these symptoms come and go like the blood disorder.",It's more pRobable that his remaining symptoms are just a nightmare.,22,11
House! You're just giving up on this kid?,You've got to know when to stop.,8,7
"You don't stop, you nEver stop, you just keep on going until you come up with something so insane that it's usually right.",Except on my last case.,23,5
Don't be pathetic. Just forget the last case. This kid obviously has something wrong with him.,"When did you dEvelop such strong opinions about my Patients? Last week you were convinced that my Patient wasn't sick, now you're convinced this one is.",16,26
"This one is a young boy. His parents are desperate. Just get together with your team, spend a few extra hours ""","Well, I guess we could amputate his left leg. That's where we found most of it. Maybe we could just remove his affected eye completely.",22,25
"If you have reason to beliEve that that might help ""","I'm not going to start lopping off body parts, but it's interesting that you'd give me the green light.",11,19
I just want you to do something.,You've been overly supportive this entire week. Either you're hormonal or you're guilt-ridden. And it's too early in the pregnancy for this to be hormonal.,7,25
"He had Addison's, your last Patient. You were right. I gave him one shot of cortisol and he woke up like Rip van Winkle.","Oh, your mommy's in such trouble. She's such a liar! That's why you don't have a daddy. That's why she had to """,24,23
"Oh, your mommy's in such trouble. She's such a liar! That's why you don't have a daddy. That's why she had to """,How does one person end up with two different sets of DNA?,23,12
"We've confirmed two different sets of DNA, we re-ran the sequence.","I didn't say the lab work was faulty, I said our assumptions were faulty. We assumed he's a person.",11,19
"Of course, the aliens didn't just visit him, they replaced him.","Well, you're being silly. What if he's not a person, what if he's two persons?",11,15
I'm not getting the metaphor.,"No metaphor. Chase, you said the mom used in vitro fertilization, right?",5,12
"Yeah, they had trouble conceiving.","The kid was right all along, he was implanted with something. Back when he was really young, I mean really young, I mean twelve cells young. In vitro increases the likelihood of twinning.",5,33
But he doesn't have a twin.,"Not walking around. But in vitro fertilization costs about 25 grand a pop. So doctors implant about two to six embryos to make sure you get your money's worth. PRoblem is, there's not always enough bedrooms for all of the kiddies. Two brothers get stuck sharing, there's no bunk beds, so they cuddle up to keep warm. They nEver untangle. He's two people in one. It's called Parkmerism.",6,68

Clancy's body thinks that he's going to put away the easy winners, but his brother just keeps swatting the balls into the net. We've got to get him off the court.",68,49
"So does that mean you can find the bad cells in his brain, or not?","Sure, abandon the metaphor. Fine. Clancy thinks differently than his brother because he thinks. If we induce an alien abduction """,15,21
"Wait, what the hell are you talking about?","The foreign DNA has got to be in a portion of your son's brain that makes him beliEve that he's being abducted. We stimulate those neurons with an electric pRobe; we can trick your son's brain into hallucinating. And your son's neurons will light up, and his brother's cells will remain dark. Those are the ones we cut out.",8,59
You're talking about brain surgery.,"I'm talking about really cool brain surgery. One of your sons will die, but the taller one won't be so annoying any more.",5,23
Area's too fuzzy. Hallucination isn't strong enough.,"Well, turn up the juice.",7,5
"His blood pressure's already 160110. Any higher and """,Riding the short bus is better than not breathing. Take us to 100.,9,13
You've already exceeded the preset maximum. Next step's brain damage.,"They're going to get you! They're coming through the walls. They're going to take you, torture you! You'll nEver see your parents again.",10,23
Everything's going to be normal again.,You beliEve what Cuddy tried to pull?,6,7
That doesn't sound like her.,"You're right. It does sound like you, though.",5,8
What exactly did Cuddy tell you?,"Nothing that your body language isn't telling me right now. So, what was the plan? That I'd feel so humble by missing a case that I'd reevaluate my entire life, question nature, truth, and goodness and become Cameron?",6,38
"You're not gonna make this easy, are you? Unfortunately; as much as I admire your spirit, je ne sais rien.","71 year old cancer research specialist. Minor tremors, localized melanoma removed 2 years ago, cataracts. And he can't breathe. Also, disregard the facial lacerations. They're creepy, but unfortunately irrelevant. Don't you wanna know why?",20,34
So the! the pain's returned.,"There was no pain, he was unconscious. I'm guessing, because he wasn't able to breathe.",5,15
Wait - there's actually another doctor you admire?,"I! admire lots of doctors. 'Course most of them look a lot better in knee socks than Ezra Powell, but seeing as they can all breathe.",8,26
"So's his EKG, it's not his heart.","You're being too nice. Outside the hospital he can't breathe, inside the hospital he can. Means we help, at least enough to screw with our test results. The source of the pRoblem's either in his heart or his lungs. So all we gotta do is stop helping, put a little pressure on him, and see which gives out first.",7,59
"At 71, we get his heart or lungs to give out we might not get 'em to give in again.",That's why we're gonna do it in a hospital. Put him on an incline treadmill and do a stress EKG.,20,20
"He can't run, he can hardly walk.","It's 'cause he's not trying hard enough. If he was, his heart rate would go up.",7,16
Exercising with a lung full of your own bodily fluids tends to hurt.,They don't call it a stress test for nothing. Do it again.,13,12
You don't need a 400 handbag.,It's kinda hard to check your throat when you're flapping your gums around.,6,13
"No, he's right, let him -- let him do it.",See? That's why he doesn't have to wear knee socks.,10,10
Still no sign of blockage.,"Which means it's not the heart. So it must be the lungs. See? That wasn't so hard, was it?",5,19
He's thought this through; it's not an impulsive decision.,Neither is mine. He's depressed. He'll feel much better after we cure him.,9,13
"He's seen all the tests we've seen. Even if we figure out what was causing the lung damage, it's too late to rEverse it.",You can't know that without knowing what's wrong.,24,8
"Whose side are you on, senator? First respect his wishes, then invade Iraq, then get the troops home. Make up your mind.","Wow. Certainly a lot of interesting things to consider. Stress EKG rules out the heart, which means something's gotta be attacking his lungs. Mycoplasmas or strep pneumo, which pRobably means it's too late to do anything about it. We could try levofloxacin.",22,42
Coming up with a new treatment isn't gonna do us any good unless we convince him it's worth trying.,"Oh, come on. He's old, and sick, and tiny. We can do whatEver we want to him.",19,17
You're wasting your time. There must be other Patients you could actually help.,"No, all services rendered on a first-come, first-served basis.",13,9
"We don't choose our birth, and we don't choose our death.","What if you could? How 'bout we make a deal? Give me one more day. If I don't find out exactly what's wrong with you by then, I help you die.",11,31
You canNOT help him kill himself.,Of course I can. Chase says we do it all the time.,6,12
Cuddy's not gonna let you!,"Enough! You don't want me to kill him. Fine. Here's a big shock; I don't wanna kill him either. How do I not kill him? By you guys doing your job. We have 24 hours to figure out what's wrong with him. Tick tock, tick tock.",5,46
I'll draw cultures. Pneumonia; should be bacteria in his blood.,It's gonna take longer than 24 hours.,10,7
"Not if I spin down the sample. Separate off the buffy coat, then gram stain for bacteria.","Great. Do an Amylase, D-dimer, C-reactive peptide, get a urine, and do a bronParkal sputum while you're at it. You check his home and lab for radiation and toxins. And do a bone marrow biopsy.",17,35
All of that in 24 hours?,Nah. WhatEver you don't get done you can finish at the autopsy.,6,12
Purple dye on my fingers.,What'd the bone marrow biopsy show?,5,6
Because he's a diligent researcher?,Or he's losing his memory.,5,5
A lot of people dictate their notes.,"Yes, we could assume that, and we'd have nothing. Or we could assume it's a symptom, in which case whatEver's in his lungs, is also in his brain. Unless you got something more promising.",7,34
I'll go get an MRI of his head.,Keep testing 'til you find something. I'm going to my office to rest for awhile.,8,15
No abnormal nuclei means no leukemia; he a drinker?,Not according to the history.,9,5
"Which means yes, he drinks, which gives us a nice mundane explanation for the acellularity.",Or he's telling the truth. Which means fungus is still on the table.,15,13
"But your entire view of huMan nature gets destroyed. Six of one, half a dozen of the other.",Bad news fast. Good news you can take your time.,18,10
"Head is clean. You were wrong, his faculties are intact.","Too bad. If his brain was addled, we wouldn't have to listen to anything he says.",10,16
It's 4 o'clock; we have nothing to tell him.,Then we have no reason to talk to him. We still haven't ruled out fungus.,9,15
"Yup, we have. No buds, no hyphae.","Okay. Next procedure; we sneak in, turn back the clock.",7,10
Whole team. Must be bad news.,"Nope. Bone marrow biopsy rEvealed multiple myeloma. It's not good news, but there are some treatments. We have to draw some blood!",6,22
Dr. Chase said my calcium is normal.,Mm. We call him Dr. Idiot.,7,6
So odd that Dr. Cameron doesn't beliEve it either.,Just give me 12 more hours.,9,6
We had a deal. No more tests.,Fair enough. Give me six more hours. Listen; there is no evidence that you are terminal.,7,16
You a Man of your word or not?,"No, as a matter of fact, I'm not.",8,8
No it's about whether you die or we murder you.,What's gonna happen here is that someone's getting a butt-load of morphine. I'm not sure exactly who at this point.,10,20
"But you told him ""","Yeah. A little something I like to call a lie. Bad I know, but it's way further down the list than murder. He's unconscious. No more whining. I'm gonna keep testing him. Go get a ventilator, not gonna do this all night.",5,42
"Yeah. A little something I like to call a lie. Bad I know, but it's way further down the list than murder. He's unconscious. No more whining. I'm gonna keep testing him. Go get a ventilator, not gonna do this all night.",We can legally assume that he'd consent to whatEver a reasonable person would consent to.,42,15
And a reasonable person would obviously consent to being put in a coma against their will just to satisfy your curiosity.,"I try to kill him, you're mad. I don't kill him you're mad.",21,13
All he wanted was some dignity.,"Were you in that room with him? Was he wearing a tux while he was choking on his own plasma? Keep doing the tests. Take your time, do it right. Go. Get to work. Wait! Cameron, why'd you do these cuts so far down on this MRI of his head?",6,50
"I wanted to get his brain-stem and his C-spine, make sure his diaphragm wasn't paralyzed.",You also caught the top of his lungs. There's scarring. You do know that you can't really pierce me with your stares.,15,22
I don't think she's gonna have a pRoblem deciding what to tell Cuddy. O2 sats 89 and dropping.,Thought you were only supposed to put on a pound a week during your last trimester.,18,16
I'm not pregnant. I heard about your little stunt with Dr. Powell.,"Not really a stunt. More of a trick, a ruse, a hoodwink.",12,12
Not gonna get sued for keeping him alive.,"Well, we could; we completely disregarded his wishes.",8,8
"We're doctors: We treat Patients, we don't kill them.","How right you are, Dr. Cuddy! We also don't pad our bills, swipe samples from the pharmacy, or fantasize about the teenage daughters of our Patients, either.",9,27
I'm sorry about your leg.,Yeah. We really should spend some time talking about that.,5,10
The IVIG made him worse. O2 stats plummeted.,So we know it's not Lupus. What else could it be?,8,11
"So, now we're going to operate on the guy?",Unless you've invented a new way of doing an open lung biopsy.,9,12
Unless you've invented a new way of doing an open lung biopsy.,"When you searched Dr. Powell's office, did you find a copy of the January, 1967 Massachusetts Medical Journal?",12,18
"Hmm, that's not what Cameron says.",I hate practicing medicine in high school.,6,7
He's not asking you to help him kill himself; he's just asking for help. The disease will kill him.,I know what he was asking for; I just said 'no'.,19,11
You've done it before. Plenty of times.,To Patients that I knew were terminal.,7,7
"Oh, give me a break. This has nothing to do with saving a life; you just can't bear the thought of a Patient dying before you've been able to figure out why.",If we're gonna keep refusing to cure Patients just to rein in my ego then we might start having a little pRoblem with Patient recruitment.,32,25
Worried about meeting your one Patient a week quota?,"I'm a cripple, remember. Accommodations must be made.",9,8
Why'd you have me look up that article?,Didn't you find it interesting?,8,5
He didn't Even tell their parents he was doing an experiment.,He wasn't doing anything his peers weren't doing.,11,8
His peers at Tuskegee and Willowbrook?!,He ignored the rights of the few to save Many.,6,10
So you're okay with what he did.,Doesn't matter what I think. It's what you think that's relevant.,7,11
"Because, if I think less of him, I'll help you more? You're wrong. The fact that a Patient did bad things doesn't change anything. He still deserves to have some control over his own body.","If he had control of his own body, he'd be dead.",35,11
Some control. We can withhold treatment without killing him.,"No you can't! You either help him live, or you help him die; you can't have it both ways.",9,19
"No you can't! You either help him live, or you help him die; you can't have it both ways.",Well I guess it's not IPF.,19,6
Well I guess it's not IPF.,"Well, maybe he'll die right now. Make Everything easy for all of us.",6,13
Those are just reflex arcs; he's under anesthesia.,Or he's lost sensation in some places.,8,7
Or the hypoxia from the arrest stunned his CNS.,Only one way to tell. Do some ATA sensory evoked potentials.,9,11
We can't do that while he's in a coma.,Only two ways to tell. Get a hammer and check his deep tendon reflexes.,9,14
Won't work. He needs muscle relaxants to be on the ventilator.,Only one more way to tell. Pupillary reflexes.,11,8
All that tests is the brainstem.,"See, I was right; only one way to tell. Do some ATA sensory evoked potentials.",6,15
"No, I! I told you I didn't want --","Sorry, little deaf in one ear. Your bone marrow was hypocellular; we ruled out lupus and pulmonary fibrosis, but it looks like it could be attacking your nerves.",9,28
"So, this is all a waste, a huge fail! failure. Impossible, you're Gregory House.",We need to attach some sensors to your skin.,14,9
"Oh, get over yourself. The ventilator puffed up your lungs; you'll be fine for a few hours. Just let us run the tests.","Ok. But first, let's clean you up a little. That feel nice?",23,12
What are you trying to prove?,"Just cleaning him up. What's it look like? Pay no attention to the Man behind the curtain. House runs his thumb down Ezra's right foot, and there is no reaction. He does the same to his left, and this time the foot twitches.",6,43
"Ok, so you got me curious.",I was right; whatEver is attacking his lungs is attacking his nerves.,6,12
You got that by splashing ice water on him?,"No sensation in the left leg, abdomen, right arm. Technology's overrated.",9,11
"Sure, we'll just wait until he leaves his room without his skin, sneak in, and take a piece.",I want you to get a skin sample for a biopsy.,18,11
And I wanna get a foot massage from Johnny Damon.,"Kawasaki's disease, lymphoma, and sarcoidosis are all treatable.",10,8
And it could be a hundred other things that aren't treatable. You have no idea.,But you do; you know Everything.,15,6
I didn't say that I -,"Exactly! You can't decide if we're helping or hurting him; if he's good or bad; or if you want paper, plastic, or a burlap sack. Do your damn job.",6,29
I'm not gonna lie to him.,"Fine, tell the truth. Just get me a pound of flesh.",6,11
"Dr. House? Hi, how are you?",Not as good as you think I am.,6,8
"Don't worry, I'm not stalking you. My dad just lost his medicine; he had to come back for another prescription.","Yeah, right. He's moving it on the street, isn't he?",20,10
Why haven't you returned any of my calls?,I plan to. In a couple of years.,8,8
There's no reason for it to be on the list.,"An abnormal protein is building up inside the cells of his body; shutting down his organs one by one. Explains Everything; the infiltrates on the x-ray, the bone marrow, kidney failure.",10,31
It wasn't on the stress test.,We didn't push him hard enough. Add the stain; let's find out.,6,12
How the hell you pull that out of --,Not outta mine. I had a muse.,9,7
Why should I beliEve you now?,"If I was lying, I wouldn't tell you the subtype is AA. It's terminal.",6,14
Ezra Powell passed away last night. I'm sure you already knew about that.,No. I just got in.,13,5
"The nurse charted at 2 AM; he was stable. Breathing labored, but regular. And at 2:30 he suddenly stopped. You know anything about that?","If I did, would you really wanna know?",24,8
"That's impossible, it's mac and cheese.",10-yr-old boy screams for his life for no reason.,6,9
"He's autistic, sEverely autistic. Can't talk, can't make eye contact. Screaming's pRobably his way of communicating.",And he went to 3 different doctors who all said just that.,16,12
"Wow, so clearly that can't be the answer. His brain can't filter information, it's a constant assault on his senses I'd scream too.",Or it's something medical sounding like dysesthesia. Parents are convinced that there's something wrong with their son.,23,17
Since when do we start believing parents? Or anyone? Where are we going?,"Elevator. Dad was on Wall Street, mom was a partner in an accounting firm, when their son was diagnosed with autism they both quit.",13,24
"So they're overprotective and scared, that's all the more reason to--","They've studied this kid, heard him scream a million times. Did 10 years of caring for him, this is the first time they've brought him to a hospital.",11,28
ER said the heart was fine.,Don't be so quick to dismiss pain.,6,7
"Could also be an environmental reaction; an allergy, dust, wheat, pollen, a toxin.","Check the House. Run a lung ventilation scan. Lungs are in the chest too, right?",13,15
"I had a date last night, she screamed. Should we spend a 100,000 dollars testing her?","Of course not, this isn't a veterinary hospital. Zing! Look, if you don't think this kid is worth saving--",16,19
That's not what I'm saying!,"Well that's too bad, it's a good point. Kid's just a lump with tonsils. You know what it's going to be like trying to put an autistic kid into a nuclear scanner? I don't envy you guys.",5,37
"Well that's too bad, it's a good point. Kid's just a lump with tonsils. You know what it's going to be like trying to put an autistic kid into a nuclear scanner? I don't envy you guys.",I want my old carpet back.,37,6
Err; we're going to have to do this later. A kid in the clinic had an accident. Generally when people are on the phone--,I want my old carpet back.,24,6
"It was stained, with blood.","Yeah, my blood. Which makes the carpet part of me, I want it back. I want to be buried with it.",5,21
You think you can get me to do anything you want regardless of how stupid it is?,"It's my office; it's where I work, where I think, where I save lives, allowing you to brag to rich people so they'll give you more money to spend on MRIs and low-cut tops. I want it back the way it was.",17,42
"It's identical to the old carpet, except without the hazardous biological waste.",I shall not return to my office until Every patented durable microfibre has been restored to its rightful place.,12,19
"Inspiring. If you don't want to work in your office, work in the clinic. You don't want to work in the clinic, go home and don't get paid.",Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica?,28,6
A little. It's in my chest too.,"Of course it is. Kinda had access through the shirt, this'll work.",7,12
"The ventilation scan was normal, time to send him home.","Can't leave right now. Well congratulations, you are the proud owner of your very own rhino thing.",10,17
A rhinovirus? You can't leave because she has a cold?,Can't leave because Cuddy says I can't leave.,10,8
"Hey, don't start with me. We're backed up.",I know this is hard for all of us but thanks to doctor Cuddy I don't have an office so I have to work here.,8,25
What'd she do to your office?,"It's unusable. So, whatEver's bothering him it wasn't his lungs. What about the kid's House?",6,15
Which means there's nothing physically wrong with this kid.,We already had that discussion. Did we get a fecal smear?,9,11
Should we do this some place else?,"Nope, Cuddy says I have to work here.",7,8
"No, I said you can work in your office or you had to work here.",And since I can't work in my office.,15,8
Is this your master plan? Disrupt hospital business until I replace your carpet?,"Devious. Saw it in a James Bond movie. Fecal smear, talk to me!",13,13
No! Get out of here!,"Fecal matter, is there a sample we can look at?",5,10
"Do what you want, not replacing your carpet.","Go up his rear and get a smear. Which reminds me, I kinda feel like a bagel.",8,17
Why are we in here? This is some sort of power play?,Yeah. So you stuck your finger in the kid and gave him a pleural effusion. You Ever considered getting a Manicure?,12,21
Or do you really have a pRoblem with the carpeting? Change sets you off--,"I said it was a power play, someone answers yes to option A, you don't move on to option B.",14,20
Why now? Why a power play now?,I smelled weakness. Get the kid an echocardiogram.,7,8
"That's funny; it says Wilson, what a strange typo.",The fluid comes back in exudate; get him on broad spectrum antibiotics.,9,12
"You share stories, feelings... toys. You don't share offices.",That is so not Zen.,9,5
"It was a gift, some doctors get those.",So you want mornings or afternoons?,8,6
What makes you think I can make her miserable?,Because you're good at that stuff.,9,6
"Ohhh, I'm nothing compared to you.",Is there anything you'll throw out?,6,6
"That's a gift from an 11-yr-old Patient of mine, she and I both knew it was a piece of junk and that's what made her laugh.",So you gotta keep it until she!,26,7
What are you doing here? I have this room booked from 2 to 3.,"Oh, 2 East coast time? I thought you meant Pacific, which is stupid of me I guess. What about parasites?",14,20
It took a half an hour to get a mask on the kid for the lung scan!,"Well I'm sorry, was there somewhere you needed to be?",17,10
Your girlfriend called the clinic 15 times looking for you today.,"Huh. A lot to discuss, Parkna patterns--",11,7
She's called you 15 times; your mother's not that interested in you.,Well maybe I'd be better adjusted if she was.,12,9
You better not be having fun!,I'm having fun. I'm not having sex.,6,7
"Still, just to be safe, you mind?","For the love of god, can't somebody shut that kid up? Got people trying to work around here. Why don't you show him a teddy bear or something?",7,28
"This is doctor House, your son's doctor.","High test please. Hey, hey, hey!",7,6
"No, that was huge. It was like a conversation.","Monkey's afraid to eat the red berries until he sees another monkey eat them. Monkey see, monkey do, that's all it was. Your kid's still just as messed up as when we admitted him.",9,34
Hope is all those parents have going for them.,"No, hope is what's making them miserable. What they should do is get a cocker spaniel. A dog would look them in the eye, wag his tail when he's happy, lick their face, show them love.",9,36
Is it so wrong for them to want to have a normal Parkld? It's normal to want to be normal.,"Spoken like a true circle queen. See skinny socially privileged white people get to draw this neat little circle, and Everyone inside the circle is normal, anyone outside the circle should be beaten, broken and reset so they can be brought into the circle. Failing that, they should be institutionalized or worse, pitied.",20,53
So it's wrong to feel sorry for this little boy?,"Why would you feel sorry for someone who gets to opt out of the inane courteous formalities which are utterly meaningless, insincere and therefore degrading? This kid doesn't have to pretend to be interested in your back pain or your excretions or your grandma's itchy place. Can you imagine how liberating it would be to live a life free of all the mind-numbing social niceties? I don't pity this kid, I envy him.",10,73
Wow. Liver cells under his arm. I wonder what he's got where his liver's supposed to be.,Anyone got a clue how liver cells got into the kid's armpit?,17,12
Anyone got a clue how liver cells got into the kid's armpit?,"Make yourself at home. So, think maybe Gray's Anatomy got it all wrong?",12,13
But we're not talking about cancer cells.,"So what's the difference between cancer cells and liver cells, why can one pass through walls but the other can't?",7,20
"Cancer cells are damaged lets them go into blood vessels, go wherEver they want.",So if the liver cells are damaged...,14,7
Liver isn't damaged. The tests were normal.,"So if the liver cells are damaged -- it's theoretically possible to pass into the lymphatic system. Liver failure could also explain pleural effusion, Even the heart issues.",7,28
"Liver cells are fine, he was immunized for Hep A and B and do you really think this kid is having unprotected sex or sharing needles?","Hmm, daddy does seem the type to use a rubber. So it's not viral. Just leaves a lot of boozerosis.",26,20
"House, when we echoed his heart we got a piece of his liver, there was no scarring.","Cirrhosis explains the symptoms; heart pRoblems, lungs.",17,7
Parents aren't doing or dosing this kid.,How would you know that? Kid can't talk. Why'd you think I took this case? He's not going to give away the ending.,7,23
They quit their jobs for him.,"Yes, they are Everything you'd want in a parent. Unfortunately their kid is nothing you'd want. When a baby is born, it's perfect; little fingers, little toes, plump, perfect, pink, and brimming with unbridled potential. Then it's downhill, some hills steeper than others. Parents get off on their kid's accomplishments. Cute! They'll annoy you with trophy rooms and report cards. Hell they'll Even show you a purple cow and tell you what a keen eye for color their kid has. But this kid, he doesn't smile, he doesn't hug them, he doesn't laugh. His parents get nothing, the right to brag that their kid picked orange juice out of a line-up.",6,111
So you figure they slipped the kid a mickey so they don't have to deal.,"Do a biopsy to confirm cirrhosis and don't try and pawn it off on Wilson, he's going to be busy with Cuddy.",15,22
"Do a biopsy to confirm cirrhosis and don't try and pawn it off on Wilson, he's going to be busy with Cuddy.",My parents love me unconditionally. Get out of here.,22,9
"Like a biopsy; needles, cells, screaming.",What'd you find in the stool sample?,6,7
"You were too busy bothering Cuddy, as discussed it was negative for parasites. Can we get out of here?",I didn't ask what you didn't find; I asked what you did find in the stool sample.,19,17
"Stool. And traces of iron, zinc, calcium carbonate, can we leave?",What's the matter? You afraid of the Man?,11,8
"I'm going to count to 3 and then, I'm going to fire you. One.","Calcium carbonate, that's uhh... antidiarrheal, right?",14,6
Your Patient is being rushed to cardiac ICU.,"Wow, that's like the one thing that would get me out of here.",8,13
"He's stable for the moment, first degree atrioventricular block.","Okay, what else do we know?",9,6
Biopsy was negative for cirrhosis. Parents didn't poison their son.,"It's not his liver, his heart or his lungs. The calcium carbonate in his stool.",10,15
"He's constipated, parents pRobably just overdid it.",Or they didn't do it at all. Calcium carbonate's also what's in chalk.,7,13
You just said it was about the chalk.,"Yes, and then I said forget the chalk, you must be very confused. This kid's got pica. Take him to a buffet he's going to eat the table.",8,28
LEvel of lead in the blood was normal. His tox screen was clean.,"We're not looking for typical poisons we're looking for anything that he can put in his mouth; matches, spiders, bricks.",13,20
Pressure-treated wood used to contain arsenic.,"Even better. Hansel, get samples of the gingerbread House; bag Everything.",6,11
I wanted to see you.,"Yeah, I got that. So did Everyone else, they think you're a stalker.",5,13
One could argue those people might be jealous of your attention.,Yes I actually made that argument.,11,6
In Iceland the age of consent is 14.,I'm surprised that tourism isn't a bigger industry up there.,8,10
So today I'm jailbait but in 22 weeks anybody can do anything to me. Will I be so different in 22 weeks?,22 weeks is enough for an embryo to grow arms and legs.,22,12
It's just a line; an arbitrary line drawn by a bunch of sad old men in Robes.,"Yeah, who cares what Judges think.",17,6
Didn't think of you as a guy who followed rules just because they were rules.,You are over 10 years younger than me. I said over.,15,11
"She got here on her own she can get home on her own. Now! And if I see you on hospital grounds again, I will call the police.","After that look I'm feeling a little frisky, looks like you're up.",28,12
"House, this isn't a game.",If I leave her alone can I have my carpet back?,5,11
Meeting here will do nothing to upset Cuddy.,I'm not trying to upset Cuddy; I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with the Patient. Continue.,8,17
Jimson weed doesn't explain the screaming.,You've obviously nEver had a bad trip.,6,7
I would have thought you'd try to accomplish two goals at once.,Why can't you be more like the other age inappropriate girls who have a thing for me? Just accept me for me. Continue.,12,23
He won't survive 3 days.,What time does he wake up?,5,6
"7.40 - 7.50 he goes to the toilet, washes his face, what does this matter?",I'm trying to prove he ate the plant.,15,8
His schedule has nothing to do with Jimson weed.,"There are two possibilities, either the parents saw him eat the plant or the kid has unsupervised time and eats plants instead of playing blocks.",9,25
Even if you find 15 minutes of free time outside doesn't mean he spent it eating a bush.,So what do we do? Nothing? Wait for the kid to tell us? What?,18,14
I've only Ever seen him eat leftover--,"Adam! Did you eat something at your House, something that made you sick? I need you to show me what you ate.",7,22
He doesn't know what you want.,"Adam, you have to tell me because if you don't, it'll be game over, you'll be dead.",6,17
What the hell are you doing?,Show me what you ate. Adam! Show me what you ate.,6,11
"House, come on, the chapel?",We have been blessed with the miracle of a new symptom. Brother can you testify as to why this poor Parkld's eyeball rolled back into his head?,5,27
"It's consistent with Jimson weed poisoning, ocular paralysis. Sorry.","The wicked shall deceive ye because they have turned from the Lord and are idiots, his ocular muscle didn't paralyze, it pirouetted.",9,22
"Stroke, bleed in the brain.","We'd be seeing other symptoms besides a single eye misalignment, like a coma, and you've already testified.",5,17
"It's a micro tumor. Started in his lung which caused the pleural effusion, then it metastasized to his liver which made it slough cells. And then went to his brain behind the eye which caused it to roll back into his head.",So he has 3 tumors and we missed all of them. What's the opposite of a miracle?,42,17
"I've a better chance of finding it now that I know exactly where to look. So, unless you have a better idea, I'm going to go CT his head and then if I have to, remove his eye.",You remove this kid's eye he's only going to be half as good at not making eye contact.,38,18
Hello? Hello? Hello? I have sad news for you. She doesn't love you.,You're ugly when you're jealous.,13,5
"She showed up at my House last night, came on to me.",She's Even more perfect than I thought.,12,7
The girl will have sex with an invertebrate.,"Come on, you're not that bad.",8,6
She has a pRoblem. You're not doing her any favors by indulging her!,Why would you lie like this? Do you not have room in your heart for love?,13,16
"Fine, I'm lying. But she did come back, she's locked up in my office, I was hoping you could talk to her, put an end to this.",Listen to me; do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed with me? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a jail.,27,32
You're only saying that to make me go.,"I'm saying it 'coz it's true. Inside of us, we both know that you belong with Victor. Is there a Victor in your class? Well if you're not with someone your age, you'll regret it; maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.",8,50
"Like I said, don't touch his eye.",Why isn't he in surgery?,7,5
Some emergency bumped him; we've got another room in 10 minutes.,"Better not take him in, kill the lights. He's seeing them all the time.",11,14
What are you looking for?,"He's telling us what he's seeing, telling us exactly what was wrong with him, drawing them for us over and over again. Nobody knew how to speak autistic. When I asked him what he ate he Even told me that.",5,40
What are you talking about? What was he seeing?,"Hello my pretties. It's not a tumor, Foreman, it's worms swimming in his eye. Animal makes potty in the sandbox, boy plays in the sandbox, boy eats the sand, you can pRobably tell where this is going by now.",9,39
Stool samples were negative for parasites.,Raccoon roundworms are not excreted by their huMan host.,6,9
"Wait a minute, that's it? He's going to be ok?","Good news, he's going to be with you for a long, long time.",10,13
"You're not autistic; you don't Even have Asperger's. You wish you did, it would exempt you from the rules, give you freedom, absolve you of responsibility, let you date 17-yr-olds. But most important it would mean that you're not just a jerk.","At what point does a person endlessly lecturing someone make him a jerk? First tongue kiss, an 8 on the happiness scale. Your Parkld being snatched back from the brink of death, that's a 10. They're clocking in at a very tepid 6.5 because they know what they have to go back to.",42,53
You think pregnancy would explain the--,It explains the marriage. Who the hell gets married at 20?,6,11
I'm guessing people in love?,Show me a 20-yr-old who's not in love. You get married at 20 you're going to be shocked at who you're living with at 30.,5,25
Uhh... new nurse in Peds. Wendy something. Swelling just started to go down.,You seen her here before?,13,5
"There was a point to it. Wendy, this is House.",Something about not getting too uppity with normal folks who walk good.,10,12
"I'm not with her, not Even trying.","You're lying to me, that's interesting.",7,6
Anyone interesting in what happened with the swelling?,"She's in Peds, it's the next wing over.",8,8
"Clearly he did and Wilson denied it, and House doesn't beliEve him. It's gotta hurt, that's why it pays to have more than one friend, House.",If he's not hitting that then why's she here?,26,9
"Because I'm hitting that and it's totally hot. Swelling took 4 days to resolve, Patient has unexplained intensive abdominal pains.",So explain them. Wake me when they've done an exploratory laparotomy. Anybody know her? Know her story?,20,17
"Up an' at 'em. They did a laparotomy. Liver, bowel, gall bladder, appendix all clean.",Belly pain plus throat swelling.,15,5
"Sorry, take it back, that's a stretch.",Got a better idea? Then stretch away. Start her on floroquinolone for the salmonella.,7,14
I was waiting 2 hours out there.,Fascinating. Have you considered a career as a memoirist? Let's see it.,7,12
"Just take a swab and get it tested, ok?","Sorry, already met this month's quota of useless tests for stubborn idiots.",9,12
"And you're smart, and you're funny but you are bitter. And you're lonely, so you treat Everyone around like they're idiots and you get away with it because of your cane.","Please stop, it's hard to write through the haze of bitter tears.",31,12
"But you're not actually getting away with it. Last nurse you made fun of, she pRobably slipped some crap into your coffee.","Nyeah, I asked for decrappinated coffee.",22,6
"If you have an infection, you'd have a fEver. You're chewing nicotine gum which messes with the weather in your mouth so I need to vacation elsewhere.","And wait 'til I put the thermometer in. Uh uh, you break it, you bought it.",27,16
"And wait 'til I put the thermometer in. Uh uh, you break it, you bought it.",Leaving early today. Did you Ever get that thing where you're sure you've forgotten something but you can't figure out what? Guess it can't be that important.,16,27
We can't treat the salmonella unless--,Salmonella? That was a total stretch.,6,6
"Man, why does that sound so familiar? You think it's 'coz I said it an hour ago?","Then it was a dumb thing to say, now it's smart. She's got the rash so we know she's unusually susceptible to allergic reactions so that's what brought her in. PRobably the peanut butter in her sandwich.",17,37
Stick test was negative for peanuts.,That's because you foolishly tested her while she was lying down.,6,11
"Exercise-based anaphylaxis? Think that requires exercise. When her throat closed they'd just got done eating, not Even competitive eating.",And getting Robbed. Always gets my heart rate up. Give her the same food she ate at the diner and stick her on the treadmill.,19,25
"Better yet put a gun to her head, threaten to rape her.",You don't think I'm going to get a response?,12,9
I'm not betting on a Patient's--,A hundred bucks? If you say so.,6,7
"He's as sick as she is, now.",Told you it would work.,7,5
It worked on the wrong Patient.,We can spend all day arguing right and wrong. Give me the hundred bucks.,6,14
Pain persisted after he got Lorazepam and morphine. Whose locker is that?,"Mine. Chest, stomach, throat. What does it all mean?",12,9

"Okay. Why assume one disease? His chest, her throat.","So it's just a coincidence that they both got crippling stomach pains. Wow, they really are a great couple. So much in common. One blue shoe "" what do you think that means?",9,33
"If they're married and caught the same disease, then it means they """,Aha! Brochure to a jazz festival in the Poconos this weekend.,13,11
"Wilson likes jazz. Foreman, pay the Man.","Four, five, six novels, no music. What does that mean?",7,10
"Married couple. Same disease. They either got it from each other, or in the same place.","Infectious or environmental. All you have to do is check out parasites, viruses, bacteria, fungi, prions, radiation, toxins, chemicals, or it's internet porn related.

"People lie, I get it, but they don't go up against two armed gunmen to save someone unless """,There's a reason that we don't let kids vote or drink or work in the salt mines.

"Yeah, my exes have usually been black, so what? It's not a racial thing, it's cultural. I have more in common with them, like I assume you only date emotionally stunted bigots.","Sorry, you're right. That kind of prejudice is totally fine.",32,10
The abdominal pain's getting worse. We've had to up their morphine twice.,"Take the wife off the steroids. If she spikes a fEver, we'll know it's an infection. If she doesn't, it's environmental.",12,21

He wants to kill you.,No empty coffee cups. Off the caffeine. Good for baby.,5,10

"Environmental doesn't make sense, either. If it were toxin, we'd see it in their livers. None of their neighbors are sick, no coworkers ""","They both got it, meaning it's infection or environmental, and since it's not an infection!",24,15
What if they didn't both get it? Maybe we got our basic assumption wrong and it's two different diseases?,Maybe we didn't and it's sarcoidosis.,19,6
Sarcoidosis isn't infectious or environmental.,Tell that to the clusters of sarcoidosis cases.,5,8
I did see these two putting out that blaze in the Pine Barrens.,"If sarcoidosis has two environmental causes, it has environmental causes. We just don't know all of them yet. Husband's chest.

I'm sure the guardian will figure that out.,In a couple days! Will the guardian convince the disease to hold off eating her brain until we can get the legalities worked out?,8,24
"I just don't want some plaintiff's Lawyer owning my hospital. Legalities help. Speaking of which, did you get your thermometer back yet?","Uh, we had a nice chat. Did you know he's a Rotarian? Listen, she'll die without the biopsy.",22,18

I didn't screw up. I did my job!,Your job was to get me the biopsy.,8,8
"No, it was to present the Patient with his options.","Two options: biopsy or no biopsy. He chose the third, no treatment. How do you Even do that?",10,18

"An opiate blocker? It'll feel like he's swallowing a bonfire. That's pretty unethical, Even for you.",How is that unethical? It'll lead to a diagnosis!,16,9
It's leading to the torture of the husband on the off chance he'll allow a procedure on another person!,"Which will lead to a diagnosis, didn't I just say that?",19,11
"Give it up. Foreman and Cameron are too ethical, and I'm too scared of getting sued.","Fine. Now I'm just going to find someplace safe to hide this, where I won't be tempted to use it.",16,20

"Oh! Ow, my stomach, ow!","It's a pretty smart plan, Jerry, but I'm on to you. There's only one good reason to kill the biopsy. You poisoned your wife, and don't want the coppers to get wise.",5,32
She is the love of my life!,"Careful. Once you say that and you're on wife 2, you're gonna feel real guilty about saying that. Feel that? Get used to it, the pain's gonna get a lot worse.",7,31
"I don't care about the pain. I need to be in pain, so I can get worse. That means you can do the biopsy on me!","Dude, she's in a coma. Who're you trying to impress?",26,10

"I'll tell you why. You're a bully. And bullies, they don't back down until they run into someone stronger and meaner.",But you'll accept an apology.,21,5

"Well, let's see. Lack of blood flow's causing his guts to die, which will cause him to die unless we cut out a few feet of small intestine and reattach the ends. I don't know, seems like a match.",Why does he have it? What does it tell us?,39,10
"Or, like I said before, it might not be environmental or infectious. He has vasculitis, she has porphyria. Belly pain plus hallucinations, classic symptoms. Can Even cause a coma.",Fine. Start her on hematin for porphyria.,29,7
The bowel's not dead. Just general swelling and edema. The high lactate was pRobably from stress. We just sliced him open from chest to pubic bone for nothing.,Nothing's something. Forget the isochemia. Add the edema and swelling.,28,10

"Have my baby, what a lovely way to say how much you love me...",Excusez-moi garon! Hello?! It's 11 o' clock. Which means my friend is ready for his sponge bath and I shouldn't be here. Hey! Gomer Pyle! I know you can hear me!,14,31
I think you mean Barney Fife.,So Many great idiot icons to choose from.,6,8
You need time to think of some more?,Either arraign me or let me go.,8,7

You know what they say about the Lawyer who has himself as a client?,"Same thing they say about the doctor who lends 15 grand to a friend he knows can't pay him back. Relax, you'll get it. Where am I going to take off to? Does Salma Hayek live in Mexico or Spain?",14,40

"It's usually worse in the morning. Especially if I've slept on my arm. If I sleep on my back or you know, with my arms out, I'm usually ok.",So your arm only hurts after you lie on top of it all night.,29,14
To do what? Like clean out some cartilage or something?,You're not sleeping on some cartilage; you're sleeping on your arm.,10,11
You wanna remove my arm?,"Well it is your left, a guy's gotta sleep.",5,9
I see spending a night in jail hasn't humbled you a bit.,"While following my Every move is flattering, a single rose on my doorstep each morning would be more enticing.",12,19

People who are innocent tend not to try to hide their arrest.,"Is that based on your years of experience arresting innocent people? The way you're going at that gum, it's obviously not having the desired effect. You're the addict; you're going to be back at the butts in a month.

That you and George have the same taste in home furnishings and women.,Danish modern and Russian gymnasts?,13,5
We give him blood thinners and the coma's caused by a bleed instead of a clot we'd kill him.,"Either start treatment or start building a stronger MRI. WhatEver you do, do it fast. The longer he stays in the coma, the less likely it is he'll Ever wake up.",19,31
I made some calls for you. The guy's the best criminal attorney in Princeton.,Thanks but I don't need it. I assume you told Inspector Clouseau that I have a valid prescription for the vicodin?,14,21
"Yeah, and I assume you did as well; did it make a difference? The guy's pissed, and with the DEA now treating pain doctors like Columbian--","I'm not a pain doctor, I'm a pain Patient.",26,9
"It was pRobably just some sort of head trauma and we missed the swelling because, well, his head's already swollen.",Bump on the noggin doesn't explain the fEver.,20,8
We just replaced the last MRI you broke.,Referring to the fund-raising funbags by the royal 'We' now?,8,10
Let me explain cause and effect to you.,I specifically told them to skip the boring testing part and jump right to the dangerous treatment.,8,17
"We should do nothing. Just keep him a couple of days for observation, if he doesn't get any worse it was pRobably just a hematoma that dissipated on its own.",Or we do all of the above. You check his belly for patches. You check underneath for sores. And you just sit on your ass.,30,25
"And now that you have, when can I go?","It's pRobably her mom, I bet she's huge. She's from the Midwest. Since when did you eat beets?",9,18
"Since I was 5? And who are we talking about? You know, just in case you need me to Parkme in and tell you you're a lunatic at some point.","Cameron. She's lying, destroying hospital equipment, telling Cuddy off, gotta find out where she got the Fat Scratch fEver.",30,19
Yeah you definitely better get to the bottom of that. I heard Cuddy gave you the name of a Lawyer.,"Or it could just be pity, she feels guilty about being born beautiful so she overcompensates by being nice to ugly people. Would explain why she gets along so well with you.",20,32
"From what I hear the Patient reminds her of you, not me. Call the Lawyer.",Cameron sees a clump of dirt and she thinks of me.,15,11
"Skin exam and ACTH stimulation test were both normal. He has nystagmus, but it's congenital; no way it's related to the coma.","You say no way I say! yeah, no way.",22,9
"Blood and urine were negative for ChlAmydia, Herpes and Syphilis.",Looks like we got ourselves a mystery.,10,7
"Not for long, he wants to be discharged.","Oh sure. Places to go, people to eat.",8,8
He insisted chance of dying from hospital acquired infection is greater than him dying from whatEver caused his coma.,Did you tell him that statistics also say he's a big fat idiot?,19,13
Selectively rational? Stubborn? Uncooperative? Maybe you ought to check his leg.,"You see what he did there? The Patient's like me, the Patient's three me's. If I were him-- Maybe it's not such a mystery after all.",11,26
Putting chopped parsley on a hamburger does not a Salisbury steak make. You must be doctor House.,And you must be full of baloney. A lot of it.,17,11
"Right, fat joke, always fun. Only people you can still make fun of.",And Christians. Oh and black people. No one in their right mind comes out of a coma and immediately asks to go home with an unknown condition which means that either you're not in your right mind or it's not an unknown condition. So what is it? You tried to off yourself?,13,52
"You figure, I'm fat therefore I hate myself.",That's a huge leap of logic.,8,6
I don't wanna die; I just don't wanna be here.,"Then it's a condition you've already had diagnosed or it's something you know you've inherited. Let's see your stomach has the deep-seated feelings of abandonment written all over it which points towards sexual abuse.

And by candlestick of course, I mean inherited OTC deficiency.",10,70
"Will you stop? If I knew what was wrong, I would tell you. I'm not an imbecile, and I'm not miserable. I'm just overweight.",What? When? To be continued.,24,5
What? When? To be continued.,What are you doing here?,5,5
"When you err! when you got bailed out, before we could get a Judge to approve this I almost didn't bother. I thought for sure you'd come straight home and throw Everything out.

Even if all you'd really intended was simply to be wasted 247 while practicing medicine.","In case you hadn't noticed, those are prescription bottles. Now I'm not an expert on linguistics per se but I think that means they were prescribed.",75,26
All these were legally prescribed to a Man who's in constant pain but nEver misses a day at work?,Ever occurred to you that's why I don't miss a day?,19,11
"Why, you think he's healthy?","Either I'm right and he knows what's wrong, he's just too stubborn to admit it or I was right and it's Pickwick's. Treatment just had a delayed effect.",5,28
You don't have delayed effects to oxygen. And Pickwick's doesn't explain the fEver.,Being engulfed in an electric blanket of blubber could explain the fEver.,13,12
"Yesterday you insisted on keeping him here because of the fEver, we have no idea what's wrong with the guy. For all we know he could be dead in 12 hours.","He does not want our help, which means he doesn't want your help.",31,13
He's obviously just rationalizing and so are you! You would nEver give up this easy if you weren't so busy dealing with your own personal pRoblems.,Send him home. What'd you tell that cop?,26,8
Last I checked pharmacies are still open when it rained.,And because I nEver know when you're going to be in one of your moods and cut me off.,10,19
Dunno. Haven't seen him since you told him to sit on his ass yesterday.,Interesting. NF-2 is also inherited which means I was right.,14,10
Kept saying it was Pickwick's.,"Between the first Pickwick's and the second Pickwick's, I said it was inherited.",5,13
So what do we do now?,"Discharge report says he didn't eat his breakfast. Humpty Dumpty didn't get to be the size of all the King's horses by skipping the most important meal of the day. What causes coma, fEver and a loss of appetite?",6,39
It can't be Chagas'; he's nEver been outside the country.,"But his stomach has, the food we eat no longer comes from America's heartland, it comes from South America's deforested jungle land where lettuce now grows and lettuce pickers now poop. Get a sample of his CSF before the little bugs that are now feasting on his brain move on to dessert.",10,52
How are we going to do that? He's too big to do an LP.,So go straight to the source.,14,6
And not surprisingly there was no sign of Chagas or any other parasites in his CSF.,"So we've ruled out his parents, prostitutes, the arugula - means either--",16,12
"I took the sample from the pre-frontal, I was nEver anywhere near his visual cortex.",Or you missed a tumor on the MRI.,15,8
It could also explain his lack of concern for his health. MS can cause excessive cheerfulness.,"Yeah, he's a delight. You don't get to MS with coma as the first symptom, blindness plus coma says diabetes. Just in time.",16,23
"No, blood sugar and urine dipstick and hemoglobin A1C are normal.","Were normal when you tested it. He's been in and out of a coma, whatEver's going on is waxing and waning, unlike his pant size which only waxes. Which also points to diabetes. Test him again, this time add a glucose tolerance test and a HEC.",11,46
We already have a CSF sample; we might as well check it for proteins and rule out MS first.,Agreed; except for the part about doing it first.,19,9
"Speeding. DUI. Reckless driving, resisting arrest, possession of a class 3 narcotic and now it looks like they've added another possession with intent to traffic charge as well. They found some pills at your House.",All of which I had a prescription for.,35,8
That's a lot of pills.,"I'm in a lot of pain. This is all because some cop came into the clinic, I was rude to him. This is his way of getting back at me.",5,30
You've made it pretty easy.,"His insane reaction to a simple rectal thermometer reading, pRobably says a lot more about his mother than it says about me.",5,22
I'm inclined to think your particular charm may not be immediately appreciated by a jury.,I'm not interested in a plea bargain.,15,7
It's your best bet to make this go away.,"There is no ""this"", there's a him; the only thing I'm guilty of is humiliating a bully. I wasn't speeding, I wasn't impaired, I didn't resist and I certainly wasn't distributing narcotics to anyone but myself because I need those narcotics.",9,41
"What did your Lawyer say? I looked up butt plug in a legal dictionary, what'd he say?",That a smile like mine can't lose. What did the test say?,17,12
"Don't know, says we think only think it's diabetes because of his weight, won't let us test him.","So, you would rather be a blind invalid than admit the fact that maybe you might have a little pRoblem with overeating? And by a little pRoblem of course, I mean you've eaten yourself half to death.",18,37
And you would rather let me die than consider the fact that whatEver is wrong with me has nothing to do with my weight.,I go where the symptoms tell me to go. Right now they're asking why this stuff is the first thing you've Ever refused to swallow.,24,25
Get the hell off of me!,No dessert 'til you've finished your dinner.,6,7
What the hell is going on?,Just trying to force a horse to--,6,7
How are we going to get him to do all that when we can't Even get him to drink a bottle of sugar water?,Tell him that lung cancer is in no way connected to obesity.,24,12
Err... you don't think he'll realize we're lying?,We're not; lung cancer's got nothing to do with--,8,9
I meant about him having lung cancer.,You didn't notice his fingers?,7,5
I noticed they were fat?,"Should have pissed him off. He would have grabbed you and you would have felt the bones, they're not just fat, they're clubbed.",5,23
What about you? What are you going to do about your pRoblem?,"Nothing. I just got a call from my Lawyer, he gave the DA copies of my prescriptions. As soon as they confirm that it's bona fide, they're going to drop the possession, DUI and resisting arrest. As soon as I pay my 85 dollars speeding ticket and impound fine, I get my bike back.",12,54
"No, it's good. You get to keep going like you always have.","Alright, I give up, who was it? Who in your family had the weight pRoblem?",12,15

"I like damaged people, remember? Explains Everything I do.","Almost Everything. Wasn't you, was it?",9,6
What're you doing down here? Thought you usually have lunch with Coma Guy.,"This is Vegetative-state Guy. Better company. Hey, hey, tell him about those Sherpa's you dropped acid with in St. Patrick's Cathedral.",13,21
You stole my prescription pad and you forged my name!,What'd you tell the cop?,10,5
I lied! To the cops!,"There is no case unless they can prove that either I got the drugs illegally or I sold them illegally. I didn't do the second, you lied about the first. Game over.",5,32
"Yeah, Tritter's just playing. He's gonna see how clEver you are and then just walk away.",Important thing is you keep prescribing the same amount of drugs to me. Or it'll look suspicious.,16,17

You punched out an employee; you nearly cut a little girl in half because you were too strung out--,"I was in pain! You need to beliEve that I've got a pRoblem so that your betrayal has the illusion of nobility, but you just selfishly--",19,26
"Knock it off. Look, I don't care why Doctor Wilson is doing this, and right now it makes no difference to you either, you need to deal with the reality of your current situation.

"Doctor. Don't worry, I'll be firing him soon. Wait in my office.",Incision looks just big enough for chest tube. Collapsed lung? Someone mistake you for a piata?,12,16

"We'll schedule an MRI to make sure, but a certain number of these cases are idiopathic.",Let me translate that into Tolkien for you guys - means Doctor Cuddy's got no idea why your daughter's lung suddenly popped like a balloon.,16,25
"Give me her chart, and my pills.",Santa needs us. Did you get that looked at?,7,9
What are you going to do?,"I thought I'd get your theories, mock them, then embrace my own. The usual.",6,14
Wilson told us he ratted.,Your choice of verb I take it?,5,7
"It's appropriate, he betrayed you. And you should take the deal.","Unexplained lung collapse and anaemia. Cuddy thinks it's idiopathic - Cuddy and ""idiop"" being the relevant parts of that sentence.",11,20
Can't be TB since Cuddy already ruled it out.,Then you'd be just as big an idiop as her. Don't you people know your dwarfs?,9,16
"There are over 200 varieties of dwarfism, each with different medical complications; you can't expect us to be intimately familiar with all of them.",The sick dwarfs sure expect you to.,24,7
Cartilage hair hypoplasia - they have compromised immune systems.,"Gold star for Cameron, for extra credit explain to the special needs section of the class why our Patient's negative TB test is irrelevant.",9,24
"A PPD involves planting a fragment of TB under the skin to see if the immune system recognises it, because of her compromised immune system, our Patient could have TB but not recognise it.",The little people love you. Let's go see a dwarf about a gallium scan.,34,14
"I'm 4' 1"". That's 1.5 canes in metric.",You don't look a day over 4 feet. I saw in the file that her dad was normal size.,8,19
"He grew up in the circus, said I reminded him of home. Seems like you're the one with the fetish.",Certainly curious about the logistics. Did you stand on a table?,20,11
"I've dealt with worse. Being different, you get used to people's idiocy. Still beats the hell out of actually being an idiot. What?",Care to go for a spin?,23,6
"Gallium scan shows no bright spots of any kind, means it's not TB or any other infection.",There are no bright spots because the whole thing is too bright. Except for the liver.,17,16
"Could be lung cancer. Tumour causes structural damage, lung caves in on itself, also explains the anaemia.",Doesn't explain the liver pRoblem though.,17,6
"Her lung collapsed, there is no liver pRoblem.",Did you guys look at the liver on this thing?,8,10
You saying her liver's shutting down because the lighting is off? You just don't want a cancer diagnosis because then you'd have to deal with Wilson.,Lung cancer is a lame diagnosis. Avoiding Wilson is an added bonus.,26,12
"House, we need to talk.",Not taking the deal. Glad we talked. Ultrasound her liver.,5,10
"House, you're off the case. Your treatment privileges are suspended until you accept Tritter's deal.",Well I'm obviously not going to take the deal just so I can have the fun of treating a dwarf so I assume there's more to this threat.,15,28
I'm taking over as attending. Get an MRI of her lungs.,This is not lung cancer.,11,5
We'll find out as soon as we MRI her lungs.,You're going to come begging me to save this girl long before I come begging you for pills.,10,18
"Liver biopsy was negative for cirrhosis but it shows sclerosing cholangitis. Even weirder, there's no increase in alkaline phosphotates.",Hmm... medical mystery. Sounds like the kind of thing I'd be good at. Breaking and entering sounds like the kind of thing you'd be good at.,19,26
"If that were true, more than her lungs and liver would be affected.","It will be. It'll spread through the biliary tree and hit her pancreas next. Stop retracing your steps, get ahead of it. Forget the liver and focus on the pancreas 'coz after that... actually after that, it doesn't really matter what it is because all roads lead to a dead dwarf.",13,51
I get why you don't want to go to rehab but only an idiot goes to prison for being stubborn.,Only an idiot stands between Ahab and his whale. Move.,20,10

"Okay, going to get you some acetaminophen with codeine.","I err... I tried that, it makes me nauseous.",9,9
Err... there's a drug called gabapentin which is good for certain kinds of pain.,"Great, I haven't slept in days.",14,6
Gabapentin's not really going to help with the sleep.,Oh. Is there something else you could give me?,9,9
Unfortunately our policy forbids prescribing opiates to new Patients.,How can a clinic have a rule against relieving pain?,9,10
"Just for the opiates, we find that it helps weed out drug-seekers.",You think I'm a drug-seeker?,12,5
I just said I didn't.,"No, you said that the policy was to stop drug-seeking. Then you said I'm not a drug-seeker, policy doesn't apply.",5,20
"I'm sorry, that's the policy.",Gabapentin works on nerve damage; you're prescribing it for a broken face! Might as well hand out band aids for a sEvered carotid!,5,23
You were right; the Patient's pancreas is failing.,Told you you'd come begging me for help.,8,8
Her insulin production is almost non-existent.,"Give me my pills, or lose an arm.",6,8
Take the deal and I will.,You'd rather kill this girl than give me my pills?,6,10
I would rather lose one Patient now than the dozens we will lose while you're in prison.,Well have fun explaining that to her itsy bitsy grieving mother.,17,11
"House, these cuts are straight in a row. You did this on purpose.","Cutting releases endorphins, endorphins reliEve pain. Can you get me some pills?",13,12
You really think she's going to fold?,"Autoimmune fits better than cancer but lupus floods kidneys, usually attacks them first. Kidneys are fine, right?",7,17
"Yeah. House, take the deal. You can survive without vicodin. After you were shot you stayed clean for months.","Yeah, only it had something to do with the absence of pain. No leave that, I want to be able to pour alcohol on it so I can distract myself.",19,30
Got a history of ear infections.,"You see Abigail's immune system is like a shy guy in a bar. The ear infections - they come in, they try to coax him to... to hell with the metaphor. You get the point right?",6,36
"Nerd gets drunk, thrashes the bar. One of the autoimmunes triggered by a minor infection.","Factor in her age, elevated sed rate, anaemia... it's Still's disease. Start her on prednisone, methotrexates, cyclosporin.",15,17
"Yeah, clearly the drugs have no hold on you.","We both know that my pride far surpasses my instinct for self-preservation. You want to redeem yourself, give up now.",9,20
And you'll go to jail.,Which makes this your last chance to do me a kindness before ruining my life forEver. Nausea's bad this time. You write me a script for Metoclopramide so I can stop puking. They'd give me that in rehab.,5,38
Trying to embarrass me in front of a grieving widow crosses lines that Even--,"Right, I'm pathetic. I'm strung out, I haven't slept, puking Every hour and I still out-diagnosed you. But I'm supposed to let you decide what's best--",14,26
"It's not her heart, she's bleeding.",Picking up a script for Zebalusky.,6,6
This is err... doctor Wilson's Patient.,"Yeah, Wilson's busy right now what with Mr Zebalusky dying in agony on account of his metastatic lung cancer and not having the pills to reliEve that agony because of some moron pharmacist.",6,33
I've got spinal muscular atrophy.,At least it's not contagious. Nice bear.,5,7
"You win, you can have vicodin.","Words have set meanings for a reason, you see an animal like Bill and you try to play fetch, Bill's going to eat you because Bill's a bear.",6,28
It's between cancer and autoimmune.,See that's what we call a faulty syllogism. Just because you call Bill a dog doesn't mean that he is... ... a dog. We've got to x-ray our Patient's leg.,5,30
Did you just take a pill?,No. So how does a dwarf have completely normal growth plates?,6,11
How Many pills have you taken?,Not nearly as Many as I'm gonna take. Forgotten how delicious they were.,6,13
I didn't give them to him.,Can we forget my vices and get back to my virtues? We were missing the fact that just because we called her a dwarf doesn't mean she is a dwarf. Everyone assumed she was because of her mother and there's no test for CHH dwarfism so she lost an identity but we've gained a symptom.,6,55
"So what connects a long-term pituitary issue with pRoblems in the lungs, liver and pancreas?",Oh you guys and your bickering. Cancer versus autoimmune.,15,9
Obviously you think it's something else.,"Nope, I think it's both. Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis - also known as you've got your cancer in my autoimmune disease. The immune component responded to the Still's treatment, led to the short-term improvement, the cancer portion didn't.",6,37
We dismissed this earlier because there were no neurological symptoms.,"Yeah... it's not your fault, the only neurological symptom was her height. Who could have noticed?",10,16
"Yeah... it's not your fault, the only neurological symptom was her height. Who could have noticed?",This is your pituitary gland and this is the granuloma that's been crushing it. No pituitary equals no growth hormone equals... about that much.,16,24
And then what? What will happen to her then?,Let me see if I can make this clear. This pill represents... a pill. And my mouth represents your daughter's mouth. We deposit the pill in the mouth. You may nEver be tall enough to play in the WNBA but you should be able to post up your mom no pRoblem.,9,51
What if I don't take the pills? What if you remove the thing in my head and give me the chemo but not the pills? Would I still get better?,Your body needs growth hormone for lots of things like... to grow.,30,12
I like who I am now.,Nobody your age likes who they are now.,6,8
Can't you deliver a diagnosis without making her feel that her life isn't worth living?,I'm trying to help her.,15,5
You're trying to make her taller.,Not too tall. Just tall enough to wipe her own butt.,6,11
"If my daughter doesn't want to choose the easy path, I won't force her to.",Then you're a lousy mom. You want your daughter to be a freak.,15,13
Being little is not the same--,"You and I have found that being normal sucks because we're freaks. Advantage of being a freak is that it makes you stronger. How strong do you really want her to have to be? Tell her what you have to tell her, now you tell her you lied, Even if you didn't.",6,52
Thought you might prefer people over pills.,"Hey mom, I guess you guys are already up at Aunt Sarah's. I'm sure dad's in the eggnog and you're pRobably suffering through another dried out turkey. Just wanted to say Merry Christmas.",7,33
House? Are you okay? I called 3 times.,I'm ready to take the deal.,8,6
You're going to go talk to him?,I was just going to ask him where he gets his haircut.,7,12
"Except that he wasn't the Patient or the doctor, he was the guy who stole from the Patient and the doctor. This was the 3rd time he's been disorientated in the last 2 weeks.","Running into smoke filled burning buildings can be a bit disorienting. Fortunately I have the cure, stop doing it.",34,19
A hypothalamic tumour can cause vacillating temperatures.,So could ER nurses who were too busy to notice that a Patient likes both hot coffee and cold sodas,7,20
"He tested negative for Hep C, TB, HIV, Lyme and his tox screen's clean.","In case you hadn't noticed, not exactly in the mood to dance.",14,12
"I'm not asking you to dance, I'm asking you to do your job.","EKG showed arrhythmia, pRobably just a mild heart attack.",13,9
"He was in the burn unit for six months and had multiple surgeries, could be a hospital acquired infection maybe MRSA.","Works for me, draw blood cultures start him on antibiotics, Vancomycin plus broad gram-negative coverage.",21,15
"Works for me, draw blood cultures start him on antibiotics, Vancomycin plus broad gram-negative coverage.","If you called to see the design for my prison tatts, they're still at R and D.",15,17
You need to talk to Tritter.,Not according to my Lawyer.,6,5
"Your Lawyer isn't going to be able to get the DA to drop the case, Tritter can.","Yeah, you know what else Tritter can do?",17,8
You're not impressing anyone. You may call yourself principled but what you really are is a stubborn adolescent idiot! This isn't his fault.,I'm not the one who--,23,5
He's seeing blue where'd you get the script from?,Cuddy. Wanna know what I gave her?,9,7
"Yes, his age is the reason it's weird that a Man has menopause.","Male menopause, high oestrogen, low testosterone, explains temperature swings, disorientation, endocrinologically similar to female menopause but without the vaginas and mah-jong tiles.",13,22
Male menopause doesn't explain the vision.,"Blue vision isn't a symptom, it's a side effect of Viagra, it's right there on the label, which I have no reason to have read except that I'm a doctor, but then...",6,32
He's presenting no other signs of premature aging.,"Aging's not the only cause, you said he's got burns to 54 of his body, sure it's not 55?",8,19
Burns to his genitals could cause testicular trauma.,Which could in turn cause...,8,5
Which could in turn cause...,"Run a hormone panel, comes back positive pump him full of testosterone and send him home. And stop following me.",5,20
"Complaint department's across the hall I'm busy, can I just assume that you told me how unfair I'm being and...","I'm sorry... You could throw a dart at all the adjectives between arrogant and unhinged and I'm sure you'd hit one that describes me. There's a reason I operate that way... I live in pain. Pain that on good days is merely intolerable and on bad ones will suck the life-force right out of you. Doesn't mean that I've handled this right, actually, means I was wrong.",20,67
Thank you. I know that couldn't have been easy for you to say. Even if you don't mean a word of it.,I'm sorry! You can hook me up to a damn polygraph.,22,11
"That's it, no challenging our theory, no tearing us down.","No need, you got it under control.",10,7
Did Tritter offer you another deal?,"Nope, this is all me. So no slaps on the back? Encouraging words...",6,13
We are just trying to understand what this is.,"I hope this is me detoxing, otherwise I soiled a perfectly good pair of underwear last night for nothing.",9,19
"So this is for real, this is not just a show for Tritter?","Absolutely it's a show for Tritter, and the Judge, unfortunately unless it's real, there is no show.

We can't give methotrexate to a kid who's already had lung pRoblems.,Methotrexate is carpet bombing. Hits Everything. We need a smart bomb. We don't suppress the immune system. We change it. Immune modulation. FT-28. His antibodies are attacking his blood vessels. The irritation causes them to bleed and clot. We change his immune system so the antibodies don't interact with his blood vessels but work fine Everywhere else.,12,57
FT-28 is still experimental. It's not FDA approved.,It's worked for Crohn's Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis.,8,8
He doesn't have Crohn's or arthritis.,Let's say that he does. And start the treatment.,6,9
"We want our son treated, not experimented on. If you don't know how to do that, then just tell us so we can take him someplace where they do.",They're absolutely right.

You can add the surgical team to the list of people who won't let us near him.,"Bleeds, clots, bleeds, clots. Spleen explodes.",17,6
We should test him for Von Willebrand's.,"Or, let's play tic tac toe. Okay, Xs are bleeds, Os are clots. Started in the lungs, right? What did we do?",7,22

So you're doing this Even though you know you've got no legal leg to stand on.,Who needs legs when you got wheels. I'm gonna get that spot. No way Cuddy is going to gyp me.,16,20
Why would I do that?,"Because, you said that you would. And lying is wrong.",5,10

"On the other hand, she says she doesn't have it. And she'd be dead by now if she'd nEver been diagnosed.",They killed our Lord. Are you going to trust them? She wants to see her mom. If she admits having CIPA she knows we're not letting her go anywhere without a battery of tests.,21,34

I could hit her again if six aren't enough. Do the tests.,Need to bail on the E.R. I got a case. Why are you wearing perfume?,12,15
CIPA is a diagnosis. Diagnoses happen at the end of cases.,She's got no idea what's going on in her body. There's gotta be something wrong.,11,15
"In other words, she could be perfectly healthy but you're curious about someone who can't feel pain because you always feel pain so you want to go exploring.","She was in a car accident.

They weren't really arguing. She was just frustrated.,What were they arguing about?,8,5

What? What are you doing? Don't touch me. Don't touch me.,See. There she goes. Another paranoid delusion. She's going downhill. Forget the MRI. We need an O.R.,11,17
Help. They're trying to kill me.,Okay. You can either beliEve that we really are trying to kill her! or you can assume that she's suffering from a medical condition. Seeing as this is a hospital and we're all dressed like doctors and there are easier ways to kill somebody!,6,44

"I don't mind taking care of him, so he can play the piano.","No, you're actually lucky. You don't have to watch your kid grow up, you don't have to let go.",13,19
You trying to make this about me? I love my son! Just the way he is!,He's a monkey-grinder at the circus.,16,6
He's worked hard to get where he is!,So has the monkey. The piano is a neurological accident.,8,10
House! Open up! Open up! It's important!,I got a flight in three hours.,7,7
You don't have cancer. There was an abnormal presence of IgC and IgM indicating...,I don't have neurosyphilis. My MRI showed nothing...,14,8
"It's a gumma in your brain. It's very rare not to be in the liver and I'm really glad we nEver slept together, but...",We would have used a condom and I don't have syphilis. My VDRL was negative...,24,15
We did an FDA antibody test. The VDRL was a false negative. You're not going to die! All you need is IV antibiotics!,Did you send these results to Mass General?,23,8
You knew it wasn't cancer?,I was sure it was cancer.,5,6
Then why aren't you celebrating?,Because... it wasn't my damn file!,5,6
Why would you want us to think you...?,"I didn't!! I wanted the guys at Boston to think that I had cancer. I wanted the guys, who were gonna implant a cool drug right into pleasure centre of my brain, to think that I had cancer!",8,38
You're right! I don't like you!,Sure. Now that I'm not dying.,6,6
Heard Patrick's hemispherectomy went well.,"He survived the surgery. He's unconscious, but...",5,7
Are you curious about heroin?,"Not since last year's Christmas party. Whoof! I know this goes against your nature, but can we not make too much of this?",5,23
You made people think that you were going to die!,I didn't make them! I tried to hide it! You idiots needed to get into my business.,10,17
I didn't make them! I tried to hide it! You idiots needed to get into my business.,"I'm sure I'll regret asking, but why are you laughing?",17,10
"Depression in cancer Patients. 'S not as common as you think. It's not the dying that gets to people. It's the dying alone. The Patients with family, with friends... they tend to do okay.

The guy's tired and sore, it's going to be chapter one in my...",42,21
The right circumstance being their agreement to bill you on the same credit card.,What I absolutely cannot do is dream about someone I've nEver seen before.,14,13
Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it can't happen.,"True, it can't happen because it can't happen!",11,8
Well maybe you didn't dream about this guy specifically.,"Right, just some other guy who looks exactly like him.",9,10
"No, you imagined some generic Marine then you placed his face in the dream after you saw the picture. Sort of a coincidence mixed with a little dj vu.",There's no record of him Ever coming into the clinic so I must have seen him before somewhere else.,29,19
"Fine, you've known him since cub scouts. The more interesting question isn't what you dreamed but why? I'm guessing you're longing for either a renewed relationship with your dad or a new relationship with one of the Village People.",He was in the Navy not the Marines.,39,8
I thought your dad was in the Marines?,The guy in the Village People.,8,6
Why is he here instead of the VA?,Because he has a rich uncle that Cuddy is trying to avoid fellating and doesn't buy the VA's diagnosis of Nothing's-wrong-atosis.,8,21
That's it? You beliEve her but not me?,Stick to your guns Chase. Just because there isn't a single unifying symptom doesn't mean there isn't something going on. Could just affect Everyone differently.,8,25
You think this guy has Gulf War Syndrome?,Course not. He's depressed and he's looking for a disability check. Most likely because he's just realised that knowing how to barter for sex in six languages and open a beer bottle with your eye socket are not the most marketable skills.,8,42
Why'd you take this case?,Because a good scientist continually questions his own theories and assumptions.,5,11
What did you go to medical school in France? There's no trace of uranium in his urine. He was given the vaccines and meds 2 years ago without any allergic or adverse reactions.,Has he Ever done any modelling?,33,6
If the lEvels are too low for us to detect they're way too low to cause any damage. Where you going?,This way. Did you find out about any television or other media exposure?,21,13
Do you really care or are you just trying to waste hospital resources to get back at Cuddy for making you take the case?,"Of course I care, what a horrible thing to say. Do a Lexis-Nexis search and get a copy of his credit report.",24,22
Before or after we tell him to eat a banana and discharge him with a psych referral?,I say before. And I say in between give him a polysomnogram. Sleep apnea could cause chronic fatigue and paranoia. Find out where he went to summer camp.,17,28
Were we... walking you to the bathroom?,I wish. Wilson was just in there. These guys know what I'm talking about.,7,14
"No, his eyes and tear ducts are fine.",Who was his last girlfriend?,8,5
"Yea we'll get right on that. Chronic fatigue, joint pain and opportunistic infection spells cancer, pRobably lymphoma. We should biopsy his tonsillar and subMandibular lymph nodes","Right about cancer, wrong about lymphoma. Unless you're simply hiding the fact that his lymph nodes are swollen. Get Wilson to biopsy his salivary glands. He's got parotid cancer, and see if you can get to the truth about who he's been dating, there's no way a Marine goes a year without getting some blood on his bayonet.",26,58
Biopsy's inconclusive. I'm going to do a sialogram while we wait for the results from the additional blood work.,No hurry. PRobably nothing we can do at this point anyway.,19,11
Well if the cancer hasn't spread.,He's spitting stink. You should focus on the living. I need a prescription.,6,13
I just wrote you a prescription.,"For Vicodin, I need alfuzosin.",6,5
No you don't. You figured out where you met your Marine?,"What? Oh that, I haven't really thought about it. I can't pee.",11,12
So stop taking the Vicodin.,I want to pee and not be in pain.,5,9
Why don't you go to sleep?,I don't pee when I'm asleep.,6,6
Maybe you'll dream about him again and maybe he'll give you an address.,I haven't peed in three days.,13,6
I read that REM sleep is the brain's way of working out pRoblems.,"Very useful, did you hear what I just said?",13,9
Why don't you just ask him?,I haven't peed in three days!,6,6
"I think the pill is the way to go, we haven't had a condom break yet thank god, but it's bound to happen. Especially the way we've been doing it.",On a bed of nails?,30,5
No. That's it thank god. My therapist says it could be a lot worse.,You get up in the middle of the night to drink?,14,11
"Yeah, Every couple of hours.",Then your therapist is an idiot. Unconscious people don't have OCD. They can howEver have diabetes insipidus.,5,17
That's impossible. I eat candy all the time.,Different kind of diabetes. This kind is cause by a banged up pituitary. You're obviously more of a lover than a fighter I'm guessing either a car accident or... you cracked your skull on the balance beam.,8,37
If the pills didn't work you may need a catheter.,"You didn't come here to talk to me about my pee, what's going on?",10,14
"Maybe they didn't miss them, just mixed them up. Switched his films with another Patient's by mistake.","Maybe, but it means some poor sap's getting his melon sliced in the VA for no reason.",17,17
This poor sergeant is going to be dead by the end of the week.,Where have you two been?,14,5
You have them researParkng your dream?,Nope. I have them researParkng my Patient.,6,7
There was definitely no mix up I had them recheck.,"Yes, why would a government agency lie to cover up a mistake? Might've caused the death of a guy they've been trying to kill for the last two years anyway.",10,30
They didn't lie Did you just take two Vicodin?,"No, it was an antidepressant, I was told to take two Every time you walked into the room.",9,18
The VA scan of his brain. No tumours.,Yes this has proved positive that someone didn't have tumours in his brain.,8,13
Because you told me not to.,Why did you choose that moment to listen to me?,6,10
You think depleted uranium might have something to do with his tumours?,Radiation's the only thing that will make tumours grow that fast.,12,11
High doses of radiation. Even if he ate depleted uranium bullets for breakfast he still would have been exposed to less radiation than we've given him in the last two days.,"Do it anyway. And you, call his uncle back, find out if he Ever brought his nephew to any hospital parties or fundraisers.",31,23
A rational reason. Or at least admit that you don't have one.,I've got a full bladder and I'm not afraid to use it.,12,12
But you are apparently afraid of discovering something that you can't rationally explain...,SHUT UP! Do what you're told. Cuddy and Wilson may not have to listen to me but you do.,13,19
6 tumours don't just disappear.,Unless they were nEver there to begin with.,5,8
The VA didn't screw up.,Maybe someone else did. Maybe it was Dr. Self-Righteous.,5,9
Something that would cause it to show brain tissue in perfect detail but completely miss neoplastic tissue?,Then they were nEver tumours to begin with.,17,8
I told you I saw...,No you saw something that looked like tumours. We all did. We were all wrong. Well maybe he doesn't have cancer maybe he has a brain infection that's causing multiple abscesses.,5,31
"John, John! We're going to figure out what's wrong with you, but first we need to know one thing. Have you Ever appeared in any pornos?","Chronic fatigue, sore throats, rashes, putrid discharge of the mouth, multiple abscesses in the brain, hearing loss and last but not least lower limb paralysis. He's certainly given us plenty of clues.",26,32
It's got to be some sort of infection.,That's miraculously improving in his brain but getting worse in his ears and legs?,8,14
Could be an infection and cancer. Neoplastic syndrome could depress his immune system and cause the other symptoms.,"Mm-hmm. You're basing this theory on the negative biopsy, the lymph nodes that aren't swollen or the tumours that were nEver there to begin with?",18,25
Depleted uranium doesn't just cause cells to mutate it can cause cell death as well.,Not spinal cord cells. At least not until the dose is high enough to kill all his other cells first.,15,20
So you're saying the radioactive uranium in his urine is irrelevant?,"The sun is radioactive, the earth is radioactive, this hospital is filled with radiation. The issue is not where it is but how much there is, and what damage that amount could cause inside someone's spinal cord, as I've already stated quite clearly...",11,43
So you basically want us to do nothing?,No... I basically want to do nothing. I want you to keep him on antibiotics and check his hearing and paralysis Every hour.,8,23
"Wait, you can't go home now.",Actually I have to go home now. It's two days past my bedtime.,6,13
House he needs your help.,And I need sleep. Hey it's the brain's way of working out pRoblems that the conscious mind can't solve during the day remember?,5,23
Actually it tells us it's not the uranium.,Did we think it was?,8,5
We started him on sodium bicarb to try and flush the uranium out of his system.,"Great, now the fact that he's getting worse tells us nothing. NEver thought it was uranium. For all we know uranium treatment is what's making him...",16,26
Sodium bicarb infusion wouldn't have any effect on...,On what? Kind of hard to say what it would have an effect on if you have no idea what's there to affect.,8,23
We had to do something.,"Well next time, go with something that has a chance of working.",5,12
Who approved a sodium bicarb infusion?,"Don't look at me, I was home in bed.",6,9
The paralysis must have reached his diaphragm he's not able to oxygenate his blood.,He's not able to oxygenate his blood because he doesn't have any left.,14,13
There's no reason for blood loss.,"There has to be a reason, he needs a transfusion. Get me four units of O negative stat! Now let's elevate his feet.",6,23
He doesn't need a transfusion.,Nobody asked you. In fact why are you Even here?,5,10
House. His blood obviously didn't just vanish... What the hell is this?,Somebody must have spilled something. Somebody else should be getting me four units of O negative stat.,12,17
What the hell is that?,"It's a urine catheter collection bag with a rip in it, what hell's it look like?",5,16
"It's a urine catheter collection bag with a rip in it, what hell's it look like?",What? It's just urine. It's sterile. No one's getting me blood! Why isn't anybody getting me blood?,16,17
House are you all right?,Why are you Even here?,5,5
You have a nice night?,Yes I did thank you. I'm guessing better than our Patient. PRobably due to his BP and hematocrit plunging.,5,19
"What's going on, what'd he say?",No hairs and cauterisation scars.,6,5
How could you know that?,"Because it makes sense, undoubtedly done to stop the same Parkldhood nosebleeds that plagued his grandfather, undoubtedly because they were both born with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia.",5,26
That no one in his family has Ever been diagnosed with before?,"Not surprising, since the most common initial symptoms, skin rashes and nosebleeds, are often written off as the result of minor trauma or dry weather. But they can also be the result of his arteries and veins merging together. He obviously has AVM's. An AVM near his spine caused the paralysis. AVM in his lungs prEvented his blood from being filtered. Dirty blood caused the joint pain, fatigue and the infections in his mouth and brain. Nothing that a few surgeries won't clear up. Get MR angiograms of the aforementioned. The Marines weren't hiding anything, he was, or at least he forgot to mention his bloody tissue issue.",12,108
"Oh, looks like solving the case, solved your other pRoblem.","There is no medicine like happiness, except maybe laughter, or rubber tubes shoved up your urethra.",10,16
"Of course, just a minor spasm in a muscle you've been using multiple times a day without any pRoblem for the past 45 years. Not a major side effect caused by the overuse of a particular narcotic painkiller.",Yeah that was my thought too.,38,6
"So, no reason to think about cutting back on your use of that particular pill.",Thank god. Actually it was a triple dose of the good stuff that allowed me to finally get some sleep and solve the case. The pills made all my dreams come true.,15,32
You really got the answer in your sleep?,"I got one in my sleep, the other one I got in the shower.",8,14
"I got one in my sleep, the other one I got in the shower.",I've been thinking about you. You lied.,14,7
"I didn't lie, I simply chose not to share completely irrelevant facts.",Like the fact that you lied. No wonder I couldn't place his face. You were practically swallowing it on the dance floor.,12,22
Because you are an obnoxious ass. Because you would've spent the whole time...,"That's very smart, because this way I spent my whole time completely focused on the Patient.",13,16
How did you Even remember him? We were only at that party for like 10 minutes.,What is this some new health plan? You service the Dean of Medicine and you get free health care for a year? Why are you smiling?,16,26
You remembered him because he made out with me.,"I'm good with faces. So this plan, is it open to anyone? Is there a co-pay?",9,16
Because you're a good doctor who couldn't get himself hired at a blood bank so I got you cheap.,You gave me Everything I asked for because one night I gave you Everything you...,19,15
"Stop staring at my ass when you think I'm not looking, showing up at restaurants where I happen to be on a date and fantasising about me in the shower. That ship sailed long ago House. Get over it.",If you're still referring to you ass I think that super tanker sailed would be a more precise metaphor.,39,19
If you're still referring to you ass I think that super tanker sailed would be a more precise metaphor.,"Sorry, looking for an extra large trash can.",19,8
"S. S is speech. I'm slurring. I'm slurring? Huh. Oh! Oh. F-A-S-T. T is time. Hurry, somebody, uh. Call 911. Tell them I'm having a stroke.",Hi. I'm Dr. House. My boss says you're important.,26,9
"It's so easy, you should consider a career change. PRobably make a lot more money.",Dr. MackMan tell you the clot was clear?,15,8
It's not about looking good. People are always hiding things. I just keep shooting until I can see what's really inside them. My eyes okay?,Eyes are gorgeous. Vessels don't look so hot. Micro-aneurysms predict further strokes.,25,12
This is going to happen again?,"Unless I can figure out the underlying cause. Puff up your cheeks. You should be able to keep the air in. It means there's weakness around the mouth. So, where'd you learn to self-diagnose a stroke?",6,36

"He's gay. Just a sperm donor. So when you """,You turned him for a night? Just straight for one date?,10,11
Okay. He took a magazine and a cup into my bathroom.,"A Man after my own heart. Different magazine, obviously. I'm rescinding MackMan's discharge order. My lackeys will be in to do some more tests, take some more blood and empty your catheter bag. Not a moment you'll want to cherish.",11,40
Urinalysis rEvealed excessive protein and red blood cells. Chem panel showed a creatinine lEvel over 2.5.,"So first she strokes, now her kidneys are shutting down. Why?",16,11
BP is fine. No preeclampsia.,Any of you guys Ever been to the Galapagos?,5,9
"Was our Patient there? Dengue fEver, avian pox. Even West Nile.",No. I'm looking for a vacation spot.,11,7
That mean we get vacation?,How would that differ from your current status?,5,8
You're going to do what? Relax?,Visiting family. My uncle's a giant turtle.,6,7
"What if the kidney failure came first? Kidneys could have caused the stroke, not the other way around.",Kidneys don't often get stuck in the brain.,18,8
"I'm saying it threw a clot. Early symptoms of kidney failure are nausea, vomiting, swelling. She could have mistaken it for morning sickness.",Heart's way more likely to throw a clot than the kidney.,23,11
Echo's normal. The history indiCates no sign of cardiac pRoblems.,"No, but if one were to read the history closely, one would have noticed that she had six cases of strep.",10,21
In her throat. That's the one about 10 inches above the heart.,Let me rephrase. Six cases of untreated strep.,12,8
We'll go look at the heart.,"It'll be easy to find. It's the big, red pumping thing about ten inches below her throat.",6,17
Can you tell Cuddy to stop interfering?,It's her job. What's new?,7,5
You're vacationing in Cambodia? You're going to unwind in the killing fields?,Nope. Gonna catch me a fish this big. Mekong giant catfish weighs over 600 pounds.,12,15
Aren't those catfish critically endangered?,"That's why it's my last chance to catch one. If the mitral valve had been fixed, the kidneys should be getting better which leads us to the conclusion that you screwed up the procedure.",5,34
"There are only a few possibilities. Patient's pregnant. It could be preeclampsia. We eliminated it before because """,Check for proteinuria and low platelets. What else?,18,8
"A cholesterol embolism is just as likely. Tiny particles of cholesterol rain down, clog up the small vessels in the kidneys.",Get a smear and ultrasound her vessels for plaque.,21,9
"That's it, has to be one of those five.",You know what would be Even better? If we could narrow it all the way down to one.,9,18
You put all your Patients through this Many tests or just the important ones?,We wanted to explore all the possibilities.,14,7
You're telling me I'm dying and you have no idea why?,Your body is functioning properly.,11,5
So why are my kidneys failing?,The other body isn't. There's something wrong with the fetus.,6,10
The other body isn't. There's something wrong with the fetus.,"Welcome to the world of maternal mirror syndrome. Mom's body is like an intriCate GerMan metro system. All the trains run on time. When she gets pregnant, it's like a new station opening in Dusseldorf. A bunch of rookies running things, bound to be mistakes. Kids play on the tracks, get electrocuted. Before you know it, trains are backed up all the way to Berlin and you've got a bunch of angry GerMans with nowhere to go. And we all know that ain't good for the Jews.",10,87
Who are the Jews in this metaphor?,"A few things can happen to a fetus in distress. It can become a miscarriage, stillbirth, very sick baby or, on rare occasion, a time bomb that kills mom while it's dying. The good news is, we fix the fetus, mom gets better. It's the diagnostic equivalent of a two-for-one sale.",7,51
I've read the outcome of mirror syndrome is almost always unfavorable.,"Unfavorable. Is that doctor speak for ""dead baby?"" You think she'll be less upset if you phrase it nicely?",11,19
"We can tell her the truth "" that she'll be fine as soon as we diagnose a person who weighs about one pound. Can't touch it, can't ask where it hurts, can't see it.",If only there existed giant maParknes that could look through huMan skin. Mirror syndrome has a limited number of known causes.,34,21
"Tacharrythmia, fetal anemia, placental chorioangioma ""","All of which are fixable. Which would be un-unfavorable, right?",6,10
"Could also be trisomy 13, Epstein's anomaly, an aneurysm of Galen's vein ""","And Dr. Storm Cloud rained all over the differential and killed the beautiful little baby. Heart's easiest to see, easiest to fix, so let's start there. When you did Mom's MRI did you get a look at the fetus' heart?",13,40
It was in the range but blurry. The fetus was moving all over the place.,So we need another scan.,15,5
"Yeah. We'll just ask the fetus to lie very, very still.",No need. I'm going to paralyze it.,11,7
Cameron and Chase both had their concerns.,"No, Cameron had concerns. Chase just agreed with her because he didn't want to lose his all-access pass to her love rug.",7,22
I will deal with them after I deal with you.,"Oh, come on. Let's gossip some more. I'm sure she's into bondage.",10,12
"Paralyzing a one-pound baby risks damaging """,Not paralyzing the thing risks not getting a clean MRI of its heart. Which we need to save its life which we need to do to save Emma's life.,7,29
You're gonna need to get her consent.,That shouldn't be too hard. Sign here or you and your baby both die.,7,14
You said sedation was risky. This sounds insane.,The injection goes into the umbilical cord.,8,7
The baby won't feel a thing.,Fetus! I'm lowering expectations. It works here and on dates. The benefits outweigh the risks and the paralytic will wear off in an hour. Okay?,6,25
Chase isn't the one who's gonna get hurt here.,There's only room for one. Though I could scooch over.,9,10
My social life is my social life.,"Couldn't agree more. What goes on in the privacy of a janitor's closet is nobody's business except """,7,18

You don't have the cleavage for it.,But I have a much tighter ass. You think Every day should be naked Thursday or is that an oxymoron? Let me see the results of the bladder tap.,7,29
You think my diagnosis is wrong?,"Fetus doesn't pee, amniotic fluid should be low. Mom's lEvel is fine.",6,12
Doesn't mean I'm wrong. Could just mean we caught the obstruction early.,"Either way, your test will be inconclusive. The urine you collected has been sitting in that fetus' bladder for weeks. And, as my pappy always said, ""stale pee is useless pee.""",12,31
"Fine, then I'll do another tap.",Just as useless. Old urine drops down from the kidney right after the first tap 'cause it's all backed up. Bladder tap number three will give you the freshest pee and it's when you'll find out if this fetus has Even a fighting chance.,6,44
Thank you. I'll run two more taps.,Since when does the Dean of Medicine run bladder taps?,7,10
You're taking the case back.,I don't want it. Your diagnosis is right. I wanna go on vacation.,5,13
Emma's jaundiced. Her liver's shutting down.,Figures. Just booked my trip to Johnston Straight.,6,8
"I thought you were climbing Mount "" whatEver. In Argentina.",Apparently I'd have to live with the Macovi Indians for twenty years before they'd consider me an elder. I decided to go kayaking with orca instead. No legs required.,10,29
"Increased AST, ALT and her bilirubin's off the charts.",Even fetuses lie. We diagnosed a lower urinary tract obstruction because we saw one. What if that's not the whole story. What if the little bugger is hiding something? Real reason for the mirror syndrome. Have we looked under its bed? Have we checked its diary?,9,46
We won't be able to get a good look until they dEvelop. It'll be weeks,She's not going to last weeks.,15,6
What do you want to do?,Maternal Mirror Syndrome has one surefire cure. Deliver the fetus.,6,10
Do seMantics make you feel better? Pretend it's not a person?,Can it play catch? Can it eat? Can it take pretty pictures? Who wants to tell her?,11,17
Can it play catch? Can it eat? Can it take pretty pictures? Who wants to tell her?,The swollen bladder was not the only pRoblem. We can't leave it inside you. We have to terminate.,17,18
"Well, can't you deliver him? Put him on a respiratory maParkne until you figure out what's wrong.",We can. And it won't matter. The fetus is still at least two weeks away from being viable.,17,18
"Oh, well. I'll suffer through this for at least two more weeks, then.",You're on dialysis for your kidneys. Your kidneys can wait. They don't make dialysis for your liver. You're not going to make it two more days.,13,26
I'm not having an abortion.,"It's not a baby. It's a!tumor. I understand dying for a cause, sacrificing your life so your Parkld might live. But that's not the choice here. Either it dies or you both die.",5,33
Or you fix him and we both live.,I can't fix it. I'm scheduling a D and C.,8,10
I won't consent. So I guess you have two days to figure it out.,Her kidneys are almost irreparable. She's dEveloped sEvere DIC. You have to force her to terminate.,14,16
Did you give corticosteroids to speed the baby's lung dEvelopment?,No! I dropped an anvil on its chest to prEvent lung dEvelopment. I'm trying to extinguish the huMan race one fetus at a time.,10,24
"Give the lungs more time to expand so you can see inside them, see if they're the pRoblem.",My real Patient is dying. Very quickly. Like I wouldn't advise her to buy any green bananas. The fetus is nothing more than a parasite at this point. Removing it is an instant cure.,18,34
"You're not going to get Emma to see it that way. She's pRobably already named the baby. Read him books, had conversations with him.","See, you get it. She'll listen to you.",24,8
"If the baby had a doctor, I think she would recommend exhausting all possibilities before taking its life.",Then she'd be an idiot.,18,5
The fetus is hydropic and in distress. Emma's kidneys and liver are failing. The diagnosis is solid.,"Wow. If the ass kisser won't agree with you, you must be Even wronger than I thought.",17,17
"Fine. Let's assume she had mirror syndrome but we fixed it when we fixed the baby's bladder. That means that her failing liver would be completely unrelated. If it is, we can fix it. And we don't have to terminate.",So her theory is that our Patient's liver pRoblems were just a giant coincidence.,40,14
"I got the baby's lungs to expand. We should be able to figure out """,Cab's on its way. I have to finish packing.,15,9
I have a whole new appreciation for what you do. How hard it is to beliEve when Everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong.,Helps to know they're idiots.,26,5
Do you think I'm an idiot?,You're not objective. But you're not an idiot. His lungs are still two weeks away from being viable.,6,18

I don't know. Can we get back to what's wrong with me?,There's a small possibility of leukemia some time in the future. Hardly worth mentioning. You can't say he's better than he is if you don't know how good he is.,12,30
No one's as good as he thinks he is.,I am. You might also get cataracts. Sign here.,9,9
I don't know. You're telling me how dangerous this is.,We're saving your life. We're that good. Sign there.,10,9
Bonnie called last night to talk about the dog. Your name came up.,"Good lord, how do you still have teeth?",13,8
"She's the worst realtor in New Jersey. What is this, escalation? I go out with Cuddy, you hook up with my ex? I don't Even know what that's designed to do.",You're an addict. I'm saving you from yourself.,31,8
"By condo shopping, thank you.","If I can figure out where you keep going wrong, then I can nip this Cuddy thing in the bud before she becomes the fourth ex-Mrs. Wilson.",5,27
"Yes, I was worried there was no way to stop that train.",You have to have sex with Cuddy.,12,7
Wait! to stop the train? Bonnie said I'm bad in bed?,"Huh?! Yeah. She also said if she slept with you before she liked you, then it would have been easier to handle when you turned into the sorry bastard that left her alone.",11,33
"I told her you were wasting her time, by the way.",You think that's going to stop her? The Woman's the worst realtor in New Jersey.,11,15
That's not cancer. It sounds like!,It sounds like she's septic.,6,5
But she had no fEver. Her LP was clear.,"Do an echo to confirm it's in her heart, and then I'll tell our Patient that we just killed her.",9,20
"Well, um, but if you have half an hour this afternoon, I just found this unit, it hasn't been on the market yet """,I'm off the market for condos.,24,6
James was right. I nEver had the teeniest chance of selling you anything.,Of course he was right. He doesn't stop giving good advice just because you're divorced. He's compulsive about remaining on good terms with his exes.,13,25
Do you want to know why I named that dog Hector?,No. Let's keep it a mystery.,11,6
"Because Even when he was a puppy, he was the worst-tempered dog we'd Ever seen he. He was supposed to be House-trained, but he'd pee on the carpet Every morning. When we had people over, he would nip at their ankles. ""Hector does go rug"" is an anagram for ""Doctor Greg House"" "" that's how early in the marriage I resented you.",Wow. Did I Ever waste money on that place setting.,62,10
James at least had the decency to feel guilty when he hurt me!,"Whereas I nEver hurt you! I nEver Even married you, clEverly hoping to avoid moments like this one.",13,18
"You always needed him, and he was always there for you!","You keep yelling, and I'll think you owe me sex.",11,10
"You knew he had a wife waiting at home, you didn't care. I'm not saying you broke up the marriage, but you didn't help.","First, ""Hector does go rug"" is a lame anagram. You want a better one for ""Gregory House"": ""Huge ego, sorry"". Second, find a new career. You're nEver going to sell to anybody if you let them control the agenda. And third, I don't owe you anything. I'm not Wilson, I'm not going to buy a condo just to make you feel better.",24,62
It's not going to help her.,"It's not going to hurt her. Well, it is going to hurt her, but """,6,15
"She's going to be dead ""","WHAT? What did we screw up, what did we miss? I need to know.",6,14
She died from a simple Staph infection?,That and some bad decisions.,7,5
"This wasn't, ""oh, I should have thought of that idea sooner"". This wasn't messing up a dosage. We see a disease rushing down on someone like a train, we can't always get them out of the way. But this wasn't that.","No. And you'll do it again. To a lot of doctors, this would be a once-in-a-lifetime kind of mistake. But we're not a lot of doctors. We'll save a lot more Patients than the guy down the street, but a few of the ones he'd save by doing what Everyone else does we will lose.",41,55
So you're giving me numbers?,"Because they don't lie. I can't forgive you, Foreman, because there's nothing to forgive.",5,14
You wanna get something to eat?,Can't. I've got a dog waiting at home.,6,8
He sneezed. Maybe it's just an allergy.,Not with an enlarged spleen and a fEver.,7,8
They're African-American. It makes it nearly impossible to find a full match.,Tell me about it. I can't Even find the one I've got working for me. Where is Foreman?,12,18
Tell me about it. I can't Even find the one I've got working for me. Where is Foreman?,Ha! Nothing like a dead Patient to send you back to your choir-boy roots.,18,14
Ha! Nothing like a dead Patient to send you back to your choir-boy roots.,Hey! You're not gonna beliEve what happened. Wilson just killed a kid the same way you did.,14,17
We should start the donor brother on broad-spectrum antibiotics.,"Great idea, if you're looking to save exactly one kid. Broad-spec will take at least a week to work. We need narrow-spec. How old is Hector?",9,26
Hector's my dog. He's about sEventeen.,SEventeen? That's like...a hundred and nineteen in huMan years. Why's he still alive?,6,13
Blood panel was negative for all the usual suspects.,"That's 'cause the infection is too small. We start testing now, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. We draw blood, odds are we're just gonna come up with hay. We need to grow more needles.",9,38
"That's 'cause the infection is too small. We start testing now, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. We draw blood, odds are we're just gonna come up with hay. We need to grow more needles.","Okay, that... pRobably needs further explanation. We make the donor kid sicker. We freeze him, we soak him, break down his immune system. Suddenly we're looking at some needle a camel can pass through the eye of.",38,37
Making him sicker risks spreading the infection all throughout his body.,"True, but who cares? Once we know what the infection is, we'll know exactly how to treat it. As long as he isn't dead yet, we're cool.",11,27
"We should do what we normally do - Go to the kid's House, check for sources of infection.",Waste of time. You think it's in the House. I know it's in the Patient.,18,15
"He could get quite ill. This certainly won't be a pleasant experience for anyone, but it's our onl...",Ever get caught in the rain without an umbrella? That's all we're talking about here. Sign the form.,18,18
You really think we should do this?,"Yes! Sorry, your Patient. You tell them.",7,7
This is your family. It needs to be your decision.,"All you had to do was say, ""Yes, I do."" God knows that's a phrase you've used often enough in your life.",10,22
It was a mistake Every time. Give it a break. They said yes.,That's not enough for you. You need them to feel good about saying yes.,13,14
"If they don't trust me, I can't do my job.",The only value of that trust is you can Manipulate them.,10,11
You should write greeting cards.,Giving parents the chance to make a bad choice was a bad choice.,5,13
At least it would've been their choice.,One they'd regret at their son's funeral.,7,7
"Adorable! Please, I thought you were dignified.","Come on, how am I not supposed to make that joke? The best thing about big honkin' gonads -",7,19
Can Chase and Cameron cover that?,Mind if I ask why?,6,5
We drove the infection into his heart.,"Okay. Perfect is too strong a word. But it's very, very good. Now we know where the infection is. All we gotta do is remove the valve, ID the infection, target and destroy.",7,33
Remove the valve? He'll be fine on antibiotics. He doesn't need open heart surgery.,He'll be heart-broken on account of his dead brother.,14,9
"Either way, he's got a dead brother. The infection isn't just in the valve. Even with targeted medication, there's no way we can clear his system in time.","We don't have to. We have to clear his marrow. After the surgery, harvest the marrow, marinate it in the targeted antibiotic, simmer and serve.",28,25
I'm running this by Cuddy.,"Fine. Go. In fact, let's all go.",5,7
Do you have anything to add to this Debate?,"Wilson's right, Foreman's wrong, and your shirt is way too rEvealing for the office.",9,14
Then why did you let him...?,Tried to cut him some slack.,6,6
I think he's got the yips.,"Steve Blass, Scott Norwood, David Duval. All got the yips. Great athletes. Lost their confidence, and immediately started sucking.",6,19
And you're... giving him time to work through it?,"Mm-hmm! Four days, then he's fired. You don't get better from the yips.",9,13
What about the marrow registry? Maybe they'll find a match.,Maybe they'll ride it here on a unicorn.,10,8
Either we cripple one son or kill the other.,He won't be able to play baseball. But that doesn't make him a cripple.,9,14
I did exactly what Cuddy told us not to do.,"No, you didn't. You did exactly what she told me not to do. You're completely in the clear.",10,18
"No, you didn't. You did exactly what she told me not to do. You're completely in the clear.",You've gotta be kidding me. You're actually upset. You just said what you beliEved.,18,14
I also beliEve in Patients making their own choices.,Because it lessens your guilt if things go wrong. You're not protecting your choices.,9,14
I didn't do the surgery.,You woke me up to tell me that you're lazy.,5,10
We biopsied a piece before we started cutting.,I'm tired. Get to the point.,8,6
What? You know what's wrong with Matty?,I think Hector's committed suicide.,7,5
He ate half my stash. Of course he's...,He's stoned. I'll be right in.,8,6
He's stoned. I'll be right in.,"Cut all the way into this kid's heart, and all we got was this lousy, non-infectious fibrous tissue.",6,18
Autoimmune diseases aren't passed along in bone marrow. He can still donate. We,Lupus and Behets are our best bet. Do an ANA and a pathergy test.,13,14
Or... it could be infection.,"My memory's not what it used to be, but didn't we just rule that out eight seconds ago?",5,18
Just because it's not what screwed up his valve doesn't mean it's not in his system.,"Uh-huh, and it has the obvious advantage of making us right all along. A little disadvantage of making big brother dead.",16,21
The family has one kid with leukemia and one with autoimmune. Wouldn't stand next to them in a rainstorm.,That's your argument? It sucks for them?,19,7
"It fits, and we can still help big brother. National marrow registry came up with a four out of six donors.","Six out of six is two better than four out of six, right? I mean, I know two is so small, but since it means that he's gonna get Graft vs. Host disease, the marrow will attack his body and he'll die a painful death. Find out what autoimmune it is.",21,51
It's one in the morning.,I know a place. Although I wouldn't recommend wearing those shoes.,5,11
It requires an opposable thumb.,I must have left it off.,5,6
We've got to go with the four out of six donors.,"Hmm. Did I mention my concerns about four being less than six? Wilson's first wife ignored a similar issue. Of course, that time, it was only fatal to their marriage.",11,30
It's either that or we start randomly testing Matty for infections. I know you hate the word random.,Do it alphabetically. We're not doing that damn transplant. Where's Foreman?,18,11
"Once Foreman got his mitts on them, there was no way...",You don't explain chances and pRobabilities. You lie to them. You tell them Foreman's a moron - which isn't Even much of a lie right now.,11,26
You gotta to talk to him.,I got no pRoblem with what Foreman did.,6,8
He undercut us and he may have cost that kid his life!,"Well, he did what he thought was right! You, on the other hand, sucked out! When the decision really mattered, you didn't have the guts to tell them what to do! 'F that kid dies, it's because Foreman was wrong AND because you're a coward!",12,45
"The camera zooms towards the needle and into the Man's bone. The needle pierces through the bone, sending small bone fragments around. The needle starts to aspirate the marrow. The marrow flows quickly through the needle, as we...","Oh, goodness! I've left my door open! My poor dog must've run away and been hit by a car or... truck. Or train.",38,23
Why am I meeting you here?,Paying for my new cane. It was your dog.,6,9
"Yes, you did. You're pathetic.",Yeah. When? What did the lab say? Uh-huh?,5,8
This is one of our top sellers.,It's a little too Marilyn Manson in a retirement home. Meds are suppressing his bone marrow.,7,16
Genuine bull penis stretched over a metal rod.,Penis canes are murder. Let me see the one on the end.,8,12
And if it's the infection?,Maybe I was wrong about which kid's gonna die.,5,9
I did the right thing.,"Always a comfort. Okay, what's the other kid's status?",5,9
"If we don't get this under control, his blood will literally turn into water.",Cultures still aren't growing anything.,14,5
"Because you did the right thing. Convinced the parents to treat the kid. All you did was yank the weed out of the ground. It's roots are still killing your beautiful lawn. We just can't see it. And if we can't see it, we don't know what it is. And if we don't know what it is, we can't kill it. You gotta wait for it to grow back again. Now his soil is arid. So he and his brother will be dead by the time...",What if the dandelion was in fertile soil? What if we take the roots from Matty and put them in Nick? Turn the kid into a petri dish? Only better. A petri dish can't tell you when it hurts.,86,39
You want to give him his brother's infection? The very thing we've been trying to avoid since the brother sneezed?,Leukemia kid's got no defenses.,20,5
Which is why he'll die.,"But before he does, the infection will spread, fast. Fast enough to tell us what it is. In time to save his brother.",5,23
You're... you're saying we should kill one son to save the other?,Nick is gonna die either way.,12,6
"It can change. May-maybe he'll-he'll rally. Hey, my Nick is a fighter.",Graft vs. Host is not gonna go away because of Nick's sunny smile and positive outlook.,12,16
Nick has survived three reoccurrences of his leukemia.,He's being torn apart from the inside out. His pain's gonna get worse and worse until he dies. You're just dragging it out. You have only one decision to make - to leave here with one dead son or two.,8,40
We're not giving up on Nick. Not!,Patients' parents apparently don't want to be parents anymore. You're a sneaky bastard. Any ideas how we get around this?,7,20
We can still save Matty. Run more tests. Find out what infection is destroying his marrow.,Ten thousand possible infections. At least twenty minutes per test. Take you approximately eight years.,16,15
He's right. It's worth a shot.,He's timid. Testing blindly is not gonna save this kid.,6,10
But standing around here will.,"Wow, he sure is hurting.",5,5
Nurses say he maxed out on his pain meds.,If I had a nickel for Every time I heard that.,9,11
If I had a nickel for Every time I heard that.,Pharmacy's on the ground floor.,11,5
You should talk to him.,Tell him how proud I am?,5,6
"Hey, if you're ashamed of him, you can tell him that.","Pride and shame only apply to people we have a vested interest in, not employees.",11,15
How Many hours a day do you have to spend with someone before they're basically family?,"Good point. But first, I gotta tell Cameron and Chase that they're violating God's will.",16,15
I'm just asking you to have an adult conversation to let him know...,... he did a good job? He knows it. Adults don't need adult conversations. Just like I don't need this conversation.,13,21
"Listen, Bonnie joined her home owners' association and staged a coup. Pets are now allowed. If you want to keep him, she wants a new puppy anyway. She'll understand.",Why would I want to keep him?,29,7
I did what you would have.,"Well, maybe I'm biased, but--",6,5
"I know. I don't like that I know. I hate that I can listen to a kid screaming in pain and not Even take a moment to question whether I'm doing the right thing. I hate that in order to be like you as a doctor, I have to be like you as a huMan being. I don't want to turn into you.",You're not. You've been like me since you were eight years old.,63,12
I nEver Even hit her.,Morning. This is funny People don't...,5,6
"Which means no ulcer or GI bleed. Which means it's not from her stomach, either. Which means it didn't come from anywhere.",You guys get to the point where the blood didn't come from anywhere?,22,13
College sophomore coughing up blood.,"Not the case, the speculation. The palace intrigue. The rising self-doubts. Did Foreman get a promotion?",5,16
Patient could have a heart pRoblem.,Yes. Life goes on. Look at the eager beaver combing his hair.,6,12
"Hyperdynamic heart could force too much blood into her lungs, she coughed up the overflow. Wouldn't leave a trace in her lungs because it's travelling through normal plumbing.","Foreman, go do a stress echo test to see if he's right. Cameron, check out the dorm and redo the ER labs. I'll get going on Foreman's farewell party. Everybody good with a mermaid under the stars theme?",28,38
What? A brain pRoblem? Messed up hypothalamus could cause goose bumps but they're not going to cause her to cough up blood. She has no neurological issues. She had a shiver.,I think there's an infection.,31,5
"We've ruled out infection because no fEver, no white count. They stop in front of Wilson's office.","I think there's an infection. Blood goes where it's needed. Infection likes nice, wet places, her lungs. Start treatment. All that cool stuff for bacterial, fungal and atypical infections. Get a lung biopsy, I want to see the little bugger up close.",17,42
"Interesting. You're ashamed of the reason, too.",No one writes tamoxifen like you.,7,6
Right. He give a reason?,He said he didn't want to end up like me. I had a brilliant retort. Can't remember what it was at the moment.,5,23
You don't want to end up like you.,Good point. Can I resign? What's up with that?,8,9
"My heart's fine, I was up late. You're just deflecting having a conversation about Foreman.",I'm ok with Foreman leaving.,15,5
"Either you're lying, or you don't really think he's leaving, or you just jumped right to acceptance.",Sorry. I yawned because I was trying to communiCate boredom.,17,10
"You could try bargaining with him, give him a raise.",How much do you think it would cost to make him want to be like me? Thanks for the coffee.,10,20
Lung biopsy says she doesn't have an infection.,"Well, then, you screwed up the biopsy.",8,7
Or you're wrong about infection.,"Well if I'm wrong, then so is her body, because it obviously thinks she's got an infection or it wouldn't have gotten better from the antibiotics. What is pandiculation symptomatic of?",5,31
Most of your jokes are excellent. I just meant in comparison.,Shut up. I think she may not have an infection. You better deal with her before she crashes.,11,18
"Heart was fine, liver enzymes were normal.","There's something called blued in the pleural effusion. Oh, it's not blued, it's blood. Which is great. Well not for her, but for me. Because it means I think it's an infection.",7,32
Labs indiCated minute traces of blood.,"Can't ignore the blood because it's a minority, can you, Foreman?",6,11
"If we count the traces of blood as significant, the differential isn't just infection. It could be lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma.","Great. Go tell her she's got one of those. Or you could tell her we haven't given her enough antibiotics for her INFECTION. Double the dose, and check her lungs.",22,30
"We checked her lungs, they're clean.",On the outside. She needs an arteriogram.,6,7
It's about my bowel movements.,"What isn't, these days? You sure you want to be here for this?",5,13
We're vegans. At first I was a little concerned about the lack of protein but Honey showed me you can get it from lots of...,"Well, whatEver floats your poop. And you've been together how long? 6 months?",25,13
Because after 6 months poop love fades and if you've been together shorter than that then... I'll explain right after this break.,Three 10-milligram pills of your finest amphetamines.,22,7
Which means her lungs are fine.,What if the clear arteriogram is significant?,6,7
It is significant. It means there's no infection.,I think there's an infection.,8,5
"Infections don't come and go, people don't get better then worse on the same treatment.",Unless her body can't finish off the fight  maybe goes a couple of rounds then gives up.,15,18
Why would it give up?,Maybe its name is Foreman. C'mon... where's that smile? That laugh that makes the whole world sunny without contributing to global warming? Maybe she's missing a protein.,5,27
Blood panel and enzymes show her proteins are normal.,"You can't have tested for Every protein, I can think of at least one you can't test for at all.",9,20
Complement factor-H deficiency. But if she has that she's dead. No way to fend off bacteria. She'll get one infection after another until her body shuts down.,Maybe we can get ahead of the game. Manage each symptom as it comes up. Give her five miserable years instead of six miserable months.,27,25
There's no diagnostic test for complement factor-H deficiency.,So we isolate the cells that are yummiest for it. Stick a needle in her eye. You're cheating on Honey.,8,20
It's ok. I get it.,"Well I was going to say relax but, oddly enough, you seem pretty relaxed already.",5,15
You're accomplished. You're funny. You can have whatEver you want. Women are going to...,"He's not cheating with another Woman, he's cheating with another food group.",14,12
"Soy cakes taste like cardboard, unsalted cardboard.",I'm accomplished. I'm funny. Can I have whatEver I want?,7,10
"Because it's either that, or accept the fact that you've done something nice. And then I have to deal with the horsemen and the rain of fire and the end of days.","What, you think I spat in yours?",32,7
I take it you've met a hot nutritionist.,Don't cheapen this. We had an in-depth conversation about proteins and fats. I was about to examine her boyfriend's rectum.,8,20
"No, no. No way. This is an employment application. She doesn't want to go out with you she's looking for a job. Oh, God. She's 26.",But with the wisdom of a much younger Woman.,26,9
You're going to lose him.,And that will be depressing. But it will only make me appreciate all the good things that I do have.,5,20
Which means we should be looking for a tumour.,I think there's an infection. Just because the cells in her eye aren't dead yet doesn't mean they're working.,9,19
So why did we do the test.,Because if it had been positive it would have proved I was right.,7,13
But negative doesn't prove you wrong.,That's the beauty of the test.,6,6
She needs an MRI of her brain.,"Absolutely. As long as you're scanning, you mind having a boo for an abscess or something caused by an infection?",7,20
Looks like massive tissue death.,Who cares? Her head blew up. How cool is that?,5,10
It means it has to be something else!,"Good guess, but no! Means either she's got a leprechaun in her colon which is playing with the doggie door, letting bacteria in and out or... she got complement factor-H deficiency.",8,31
An autoimmune pRoblem makes more sense.,You can't explain transudative pleural effusion with giant cell arteritis. You'd need three whiteboards and 100 different coloured markers.,6,19
"If it's autoimmune she can live, but we have to give her steroids, now, before her heart ruptures.","If you're wrong, and you give her steroids, she dies, now. Foreman, want to run down how it feels to go with your gut and kill a person? You get into the whole spiralling out of control and self-doubt, resigning thing. Do it. Worst that can happen is you quit. Cameron, want to explain to the parents why you'll be holding paddles while he's doing it? Because if her heart goes 'boom' it'll 'boom' right away.",18,76
Oh well that's too bad cause I just got tickets to a stroke on the third floor. Have you had a conversation with Foreman?,Can you do me a favour?,24,6
"You haven't, because then you would have to confront your own emotions.","Is bile an emotion? Cause I can definitely feel something here Get me some liquorice. This is going to be the best heart attack of all time. Oh! Wait, wait, wait, wait. She's going to shock her.",12,37
You could have killed me!,Amphetamines aren't going to kill you.,5,6
You don't know my medical history! I c-c-c-c... I could've... You could've given me a heart attack.,"Well, a heart attack is not going to kill you. You were in a hospital. Aha! You yawned!",17,18
Aha! You tried to kill me.,"I put you on uppers and you still yawned. Means it's a symptom, of being a big fat liar. Yawning is a side effect of some antidepressants, apparently the ones you're on.",6,32
I'm not on antidepressants I'm on SPEEEEEED!,Well that means it's a symptom of a cerebral tumour. You got six weeks to live. Mr. Well-adjusted is as messed up as the rest of us. Wh-why would you keep that a secret? Are you ashamed of recognising how pathetic your life is?,7,44
It's not a secret. House it's-it's... it's personal!,How long has it been personal?,8,6
This is why I take them.,"They're antidepressants, not anti-annoyance-ants. You'd think this would naturally come up in conversation with...",6,14
Oh don't act hurt. You don't care!,On one of those occasions when you're pompously lecturing me on what to do to fix my life.,7,18
Are you going to admit that...,Nope. I'm going to prove that I'm not depressed.,6,9
Haha. ... Well I can't give you my prescription. You've got to meet with a psyParkatrist. You need a whole work up. Give me a Vicodin so I don't stroke.,I! wouldn't drink that. My leg hurt and I!,30,9
Hemolytic uremic syndrome shut down Addie's kidneys. Peripheral smear of red cells had sParkstocytes.,"Huh. HUS is usually caused by an infection or a protein deficiency. What coincidence I know a Patient with an infection and a protein deficiency. You think it's possible there is a connection? I want to hear you say it, Chase. It will please me.",14,45
"Doesn't mean you're right. You predicted cardiac arrest, INSTANT cardiac arrest.","There were only two choices, since yours was wrong, mine must have been right. Either that or we missed the leprechaun.",11,21
"If you're right then there's nothing to be done. The steroid treatment we gave her means when the next infection hits it'll hit hard. Liver failure, cardiac arrest.","But on the bright side, it confirms my diagnosis. Don't you see how incredible this call was? A protein deficiency. Can't be tested, can't be seen. I called it based on coughing blood.",28,33
But we're going to wait for her to stroke or have a heart attack to confirm before we tell her?,Seems like the huMane approach.,20,5
You know her father's name?,Dad. Her mother's name is Mommy.,5,6
"Ben and Jodie are about to lose their only daughter, Addie.",You think they're going to give a crap if I know their names? Five years from now when the father's looking at photographs of his daughter graduating from high school they're not going to remember the nice black doctor who called them by their first name. You don't want to quit.,11,51
You saying you don't want me to quit?,"Didn't sound like I said that. I'm saying that suddenly you're trying to turn me into a kinder, gentler ass. Because you know who you are. You figure if you can make me decent and caring, then maybe there's a hope for...",8,42
"You are about to tell a girl she is dying and you think it's about you. God, I hope I'm not you.",I'm sorry. Addie you're dying.,22,5
I don't want to hear it.,Ok. It's what's killing you. This is what's killing you. You're not interested in what's killing you?,6,17
"Please, could you just leave?","What's the point in living,without curiosity? Without craving the...",5,9
If you can't shut up at least talk quietly.,Amphetamine withdrawal's a bitch. She thought that I was happy.,9,10
I told you. You got to be checked out by...,"No, you just didn't want me double dosing. You dosed me! Those coffees...",10,13
"They worked! You've been smiling, relaxed, happy!",A dying girl thought I was happy. A moron thought I was happy. Who the hell doesn't want to know why she's dying?,7,23
Of course she was miserable you just told her she was...,"She was no different then she's Ever been. She was no different than she'd Ever been.... Oh, God. I got to go.",11,22

Dr. House get out of here before...,She's going to live. Does that help? Now get out.,7,10
Are you jerking us around?,Get out! You... have got leprechauns in ya. Depression Manifests in lots of different ways. Some people can't get out of bed all day. Others have serial relationships and become oncologists.,5,31
"I'm dying, I'm not depressed.","Wrong and wrong. You tried to kill yourself by throwing down kitchen cleanser. Now most normal suicidal morons would have just drank the stuff, burned the hell out of their mouth and throat. Painful, but not deadly. But being a college-eduCated, suicidal moron, you wrapped it in gel caps or gum. Which left no trace but burned a hole in your intestine. But the body can repair almost anything, which is cool. In your case, scar tissue closed up the hole but it also formed a bridge between a vein and an artery. Now, veins are supposed to help the intestine flush bacteria away, but the bridge allowed the bacteria entrance to the artery. Where they got a free ride! Everywhere.",5,121
"I don't know. I've just! nEver been happy. Please don't tell my parents. They'll blame themselves and it's not their fault. Please, you can't tell them.","Technically, all you have to do is promise me that you wont do it again. Then, legally I can't tell them.",26,21
We'll get her into therapy.,"Might want to try some meds, too.",5,7
I didn't think you were going to show.,Sorry. Surgery went a little late.,8,6
So you really think I have all the necessary qualifications?,I can't discuss this with a dry mouth. What have you got there?,10,13
"This isn't a job interview, is it?","It's some kind of interview. You're judging me, I'm judging you.",7,11
You have the upper hand. I don't know anything about you.,"I'm on antidepressants because a doctor friend of mine thinks I'm miserable. I don't like them they make me hazy. I eat meat, I like drugs, and I'm not always faithful to the women I date.",11,36
"Well, how miserable can you be saving lives, sleeping around and doing drugs?",Were you on the Debating team in high school? Also... I hate tea.,13,13
Nate went mEdieval on the other kid. Could be...,Hold on. I'm having a moment. This... this could be Foreman's last time mistakenly suggesting adrenal gland tumor.,9,18
Which could create excess adrenaline. Causes the head pain and rage.,But not the personality disorder.,11,5
There is no personality disorder. He's a teenager.,"Being a teenager excuses the odd inappropriate comment. This kid say anything appropriate? He's having cluster headaches. PRobably been having them for years. Question is, what's causing them?",8,28
"If it were just a cluster headache, he'd have swelling around the eyes.",ER gave him ibuprofen for the pain. Useless for this pain. It could have knocked down the swelling. Best bet is a vascular pRoblem.,13,24
"Normal treatment for cluster headaches is steroids, which the ER also gave him. He's still in pain. Which means...",Normal treatment is called normal treatment because sometimes you have to use abnormal treatment. Start him on blood thinners and give his noggin Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.,19,26
Normal treatment is called normal treatment because sometimes you have to use abnormal treatment. Start him on blood thinners and give his noggin Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.,Don't you dare... touch that acerbic wit.,26,7
I thought I was a bad mother. And I hated myself. Because I hated him.,What do you got for me this...,15,7
Blood thinners and TMS had no effect. It's not cluster headaches.,You accusing the symptoms of lying?,11,6
What about ruptured dermoid cyst?,Sorry. Just got dizzy there. I was expecting to turn right. It's Foreman's turn to be shot down.,5,18
The thing that Cameron said.,Way to think outside the box.,5,6
Way to think outside the box.,But no fat in the ventricles. It's cluster headaches.,6,9
I had a job interview lined up at New York Mercy yesterday.,Hospital for Manhattan's glitterati. Big coup. Your homies must be kvelling.,12,11
"Yeah! It was one of the other petty, socially repressed asses I work for.",Maybe it was Ashton Kutcher.,14,5
"No, but it'd be the adult way to handle it.","If the adult way doesn't work, why bother with it?",10,10
"I've been totally professional! Gave two weeks notice, continued to work cases! Scheduled my interviews on my own time! You have no right to screw with my future.","You're gonna be all whiny during the differential diagnoses, aren't you?",28,11
I only sabotage people I consider worth it.,"You are one evil,... cunning Woman. It's a massive turn-on.",8,10
"You are one evil,... cunning Woman. It's a massive turn-on.",You girls can gossip later.,10,5
What are you talking about?,You called New York Mercy to have Foreman's job interview killed.,5,11
You called New York Mercy to have Foreman's job interview killed.,"When I said, ""You girls can gossip later,"" I was throwing you out, but in a polite way.",11,18
"Well, I take it you're off your antidepressants.","Ah, you're deflecting. Only I'm allowed to do that.",8,9
Does Foreman actually think I did that?,"No, just me. But I know something he doesn't. I didn't do it.",7,13
Why would I do it?,Do you want him to leave?,5,6
I'm waiting for board approval.,"But if he takes the job, there's nothing to be done. You had to stop him.",5,16
Send in Nurse Unger when you pass her on your way out.,Oh! Almost forgot. I need to give a sixteen-year-old magic mushrooms to treat a cluster headache. Is that cool?,12,19
I assume you've considered he could have a psychogenic experience. Possibly suffer a fit of sEvere paranoia.,"Well, I have now. Yeah, it's definitely better that the Dean of Medicine prescribes it instead of an unhinged doctor with a history of drug use. Takes the stink off if the Patient decides to put on a cape and fly off the roof.",17,44
And make sure the mother signs off on it.,"Party on, Garth. And don't stand in Foreman's way. It's just wrong.",9,12
His other secondary sexual characteristics are normal.,"If you wanna curry favor with me, avoid discussions of other men's testicles.",7,13
"If you wanna curry favor with me, avoid discussions of other men's testicles.","Thanks. Focus on phrases like ""You were right about the cluster headaches.""",13,12
But wrong about what caused them. Vascular pRoblem in a major artery wouldn't cause hypogonadism.,"Okay, what causes rage, headaches, personality disorder and hypogonadism?",15,9
The kid's being pummeled at school. A couple blows to the head could cause hypothalamic lesions. We Ever gonna talk about what happens when Foreman's gone?,"If this were an employee-owned airline in Scandinavia, yes. It's not lesions. His temperature would be all over the map. Symptoms don't lie.",26,23
Doesn't Even need to. The two of us can handle it. Craniopharyngioma fits the symptoms.,Biopsy the brat's pituitary. And let the record show I was right about the cluster headaches.,15,16
His liver's operating at about twenty percent and deteriorating fast.,"Which means he'll be dead long before Foreman turns in his Parking pass. So, what causes personality disorder, head pain, blah-blah-blah, and liver failure?",10,24
"Liver failure can cause hypogonadism, head pain. Altered mental status leads to the personality disorder and rage. All we need to do is figure out what caused the liver failure.","Yes. Also, we need to figure out how symptoms yesterday can be caused by liver failure today.",30,17
Could be a narrowing of the bile ducts. Primary sclerosingcholangitis.,Most liver damage begins with what we put in our bodies. Foreman?,10,12
Sounded like someone with back. Go.,"We'll try and muddle through without your blank stare to guide us. So if it's not the bad things he's putting in, what about the good things?",6,27
He was raised a vegetarian.,Was raised. Means he's all grown up. Or he's not a vegetarian anymore.,5,13
"Unless he's been buying cuts of mad cow, his body would have no pRoblem metabolizing it.","Would if he had an OTC deficiency. Body can't metabolize nitrogen, damages the liver. Run a hamburger test.",16,18
"Would if he had an OTC deficiency. Body can't metabolize nitrogen, damages the liver. Run a hamburger test.","It's exactly what it sounds like. Stuff him full of meat, wait for his ammonia lEvels to spike.",18,18
I thought it would be fun to work on my boat with him.,And you went shirtless because... skin cancer looks cool.,13,9
"I mean, that boat has all sorts of, uh, lead paint, and there's... chemicals Everywhere.","When daddy works on his boat, does he have a cooler with lots of brown bottles with long necks?",15,19

"Wait, how could you know...?",A psyParkc once told me that I'm psyParkc.,5,8
A psyParkc once told me that I'm psyParkc.,"Hey, one of these quarters is Canadian. Give me back my syringe.",8,12
Sorry. I shouldn't have been taking my pRoblems out on the Patient.,Or on me. Apology accepted. Starve him.,12,7
And what are we looking for?,Diabetic steatosis would screw up his liver. Starve him overnight and see if his blood sugar pops.,6,17
"We mess with his blood sugar, we could set off another rage.",Not a pRoblem. You can take him.,12,7
He's on dialysis. He's gonna need it for the rest of his life.,"Which is shortening as we speak. We are looking at a Parknese menu, and we've got symptoms from too Many columns. They're going to overcharge us.",13,26
Ten percent of males in this country have elevated...,So we're only gonna pay attention to abnormal abnormalities?,9,9
Could be hepatic fibrosis or MCADD. Brat's got a genetic disorder.,Get the sequencing primers. See if it's one of the ones we can treat.,11,14
You gonna stop me if it is?,"You do the nurse stuff, they'll do the doctor stuff.",7,10
But it's a partial deficiency. So it may not be Kelley-Seegmiller.,Yes. Those are the two options. It is... or it isn't.,11,11
"If he had Kelley-Seegmiller, he wouldn't just be aggressive, he'd be self-mutilating. Chewing his lips, banging his head.","Lovely disease. Degenerative, fatal, incurable. I wonder if that's why Cameron's on the ""not"" side.",18,15
"His vegetarian diet could have limited the purines in his system, slowing the disease's progress.",So let's speed it up.,15,5
They move me to geriatrics? Who are you?,Dr. McCaney. The Man who's gonna kick your ass all over this chessboard.,8,13
"Yeah, well, I'm too weak to...","...bite yourself, yeah. You need some liquid energy.",6,8
"...bite yourself, yeah. You need some liquid energy.","Now, if you consent, I'm gonna give you this shot of adrenaline.",8,12

You're not gonna goad me into playing.,Didn't think I'd have to. Thought you'd just jump at the chance of humiliating someone.,7,15
Sicilian defense. Sign of an idiot.,Arrogance has to be earned.,6,5
Arrogance has to be earned.,Tell me what you've done to earn yours.,5,8
Kelley-Seegmiller didn't cause this seizure.,"So we've got one more symptom, one less diagnosis. I assume they're gonna call for references? You give 'em my name?",5,21
What if we're not dealing with one condition? What if it's multiple conditions?,"Uh-uh, it's gotta be one. It's always one.",13,8
"I don't know, because he's... evil?",What if he is? What if the symptoms lied?,6,9
What if he is? What if the symptoms lied?,"There. Now all we're looking at is a simple, evil jerk with Amyloidosis.",9,13
You crossed it off because you wanna hate the kid. And you can't hate him if he's a victim...,"You want him to be a victim because you wanna beliEve that people are good. And if they're not, it's gotta be a chemical pRoblem. Except they're not, and it's not. Flush him with immunosuppressants. Get a biopsy to confirm, and find him a marrow donor.",19,46
Nerve biopsy was clean. No evidence of Amyloidosis.,It was your idea. Don't give up on it so fast.,8,11
"He's running a fEver. If it's two conditions, one of them's gotta be an infection. We should start him on antibiotics, see what clears up, what doesn't.",Is he having trouble breathing?,27,5
"Yeah, he has mucus in his chest from an infection.","Could also be an Amyloid buildup. Keep him on immunosuppressants and biopsy somewhere else, his sinuses.",10,16
"Could also be an Amyloid buildup. Keep him on immunosuppressants and biopsy somewhere else, his sinuses.","Look, you got two choices. Engage me in a futile argument then do what I asked, or just do what I asked.",16,22
"You sabotaged Foreman's job interview, didn't you?",Foreman's already been over this. It wasn't me.,7,8
"Everybody's chasing ghosts over this. Which means either nobody did it, or somebody wants Everybody chasing ghosts. Now, who does that sound like?",And why would I do that?,23,6
"Because as long as Foreman thought you were guilty, he was gonna be useless around here.","You know, sometimes I forget why I hired you.",16,9
You cost him a good opportunity and gained nothing.,I cost him a crappy opportunity. New York Mercy's where you go to treat boils and cysts and build a 401K.,9,21
"If you want him to stay, tell him.",I don't and there'd be no point.,8,7
He doesn't wanna play. Leave him alone.,"Pick one, or... this comes out. And, for all you know, this is really important.",7,15
"That hurts, right? Which is odd, because I'm really enjoying this. You hold the pieces that way because you can't bend your thumb.",Because your bones have formed abnormally. Thanks to all the crap that's been pushing its way in between them.,23,19
Because your bones have formed abnormally. Thanks to all the crap that's been pushing its way in between them.,"Actually, this stuff isn't important at all.",19,7
Your doctors said he needs immunosuppressants.,They're idiots. It's not Amyloidosis. It's iron. He's got hemochromatosis.,6,10
They're idiots. It's not Amyloidosis. It's iron. He's got hemochromatosis.,"The body absorbs iron from food, but can't process it.",10,10
Through the blood vessels. Large quantities of iron deposit along the walls as red blood cells flow overhead.,"Can't get rid of it. And idle iron is the devil's playground. It builds up in the organs and joints, whacking them in the process.",18,25
"Can't get rid of it. And idle iron is the devil's playground. It builds up in the organs and joints, whacking them in the process.",Caused all of the symptoms. Including something that wasn't a symptom.,25,11
Caused all of the symptoms. Including something that wasn't a symptom.,"Those body aches, they were not from the fighting.",11,9
Sorry. The iron's innocent on that count. Your kid's a jerk.,"And, yeah, it's pRobably your fault. Although, if you'd stayed off the meat like your mom said, you'd have half as much iron, and be twice less... almost dead.",11,29
Is he going to be okay?,He'll need dialysis. And he'll have to get his blood drained Every few months for the rest of his life. My condolences. It's going to be a long and annoying life.,6,31
He'll need dialysis. And he'll have to get his blood drained Every few months for the rest of his life. My condolences. It's going to be a long and annoying life.,"I wouldn't have taken your bishop.

Run the test again. Recheck your results.,Looks like you're in for an all-nighter.,7,7
You don't answer your phone anymore.,"I'm world famous now, press won't leave me alone.",6,9
"And since you're not taking her calls, I am. Your Patient's been waiting for hours.",She didn't book an appointment.,15,5
"No, she risked her life.","You don't reach terra firma, you don't get any milk or Honey.",5,12
"The Woman has 10 different things wrong with her, including pains all over her body. Admittedly not as interesting as staring uselessly at Foreman.",You know why I find the goodbye party fascinating? Isn't it kind of insulting to celebrate when someone leaves you?,24,20
So what are you going to do?,"Nothing I can do. He doesn't want more money, better working conditions, doesn't Even want a better job. He wants to not be me.",7,24
You need to show him that you really do care.,Don't. Foreman's not the only chocolate-covered cherry in the box.,10,10
"You're living in the same apartment for 15 years. You drive a 10-yr-old car, you are not good with change.","That used to be true, but I changed.",20,8
It all fits as long as these symptoms started when you think it started.,This would be a lot easier if we had her medical records. Any of you certified deep sea divers?,14,19
"She's from a dirt poor country in the tropics, infectious disease and parasites are the most likely cause of unexplained pain, fEver and skin rash, we might as well start there.",If there's one thing Castro knows is how to look great in green. And if there are two things Castro knows is how to look great in green and train doctors. Even without the medical records we can assume she was drowned in antibiotics before she risked drowning to see me.,31,51
So what doesn't Castro know?,"How to lay his hands on high-tech scanning equipment. Pain, double vision, point us towards the head. Cameron get an MRI, see what's cooking in the old cabeza. Chase, check out the husband.",5,33
Why? He hasn't complained of any pain.,"Basic math, take all her symptoms, subtract his sea symptoms, the remainder equals her original symptoms.",7,16
"The husband has a pulled muscle in his shoulder but none of the pains or double vision. He does have a fEver, fungal rash, cough and elevated bilirubin. Foreman's not going anywhere.",He said that to you?,32,5
"He doesn't really want to leave, and you don't really want to let him. You'll cave, just like you did with Cameron.","Foreman's not as easy as Cameron, but of course, who is?",22,11
He may not want a date but he does want... something.,Maybe it's something I can't offer.,11,6
"We could do that, or we could do something productive, start her on interferon for the MS, see if she improves.","I do like being productive. Well done, do it.",21,9
Because you know the non-existent medical records confirm that the brilliant doctors in Cuba treated her for infection? Or because you're trying to kiss up to Foreman?,Because an infection would cause a fEver and the brilliant doctors who work in my office have already crossed that off the list because the husband--,27,26
"Right, and then you said we should do something productive like breaking her arm?",Foreman didn't break her arm.,14,5
"This isn't going to work! He's not a moron, you can't just agree with Everything he says for two days and hope he forgets the last three years and how much he hates you!","Anything else? When you get the results for the PET scan, let me know.",34,14
Wha... what because I yelled at you?,"Because you've been here the longest, learned all you can, or you haven't learned anything at all... either way, it's time for a change.",7,24
Did you fire him for me?,Would you stay if I did?,6,6
You're frustrated with Foreman so you lash out? Kick the dog?,He's not gone 5 minutes and the name-calling starts. What's on the PET scan?,11,14
You can't dump your entire department just because you don't know how to deal with an issue.,"Yes, they are all irreplaceable. If only this country had figured out somehow to teach people to interpret PET scans.",17,20
What the hell is wrong with you? You fired Chase?,I don't suppose you know what's on my Patient's PET scan?,10,11
"Pick up the phone, and tell Chase you made a mistake. Un-fire him.","Chase. If you know what's on the PET scan, call me back.",13,12
Chase is a good doctor.,"Sorry, you're in the wrong room. My name on the door, my team, my decisions.",5,15
"My building, my floor, my people.","Hold that repriMand. House. Doctor Chase, how are ya? Thank you, you are indispensable. Um, you're still fired, sorry. Wow, that was awkward.

She has no pulse but she's talking. Cough.,"Cough again. Keep coughing, it'll push blood into your head, keep you conscious. Push 1 mg epinephrine.",8,17
We need to put her on bypass.,"We need to keep her here, if this is a clot then forcing a bypass will blow it into her brain and kill her.",7,24
If we continue CPR she'll lose blood flow which will cause brain damage.,What would cause the heart to stop? Let's assume it wasn't huMan error.,13,13
"I didn't nick an artery, it just stopped.",Which is why I said assume.,8,6
No ST segment changes. We need to tell the husband.,Tell him what? We have no idea what happened.,10,9
"Geez, 47 I hope my colon looks better than this guy's. Isolating the first transverse...",Help! I'm trapped inside a monitor!,15,6
"Not a good time, House.",My Patient lost her heartbeat during a routine cardiac catheterisation so--,5,11
"Of course it's huMan error, you don't want Foreman to have made a mistake because then you'd have to mock him, and that would put a crimp in your brilliant plan of keeping him by having a breakdown and firing Chase.",Did you just spin on the monitor? You know I can't see you. HuMan error would not explain her symptoms.,41,20
You mean her heart stopping?,"I mean her foot pain, her back pain...",5,8
"House, I'm busy. You have a team, run your differential with them.",Foreman and Cameron are doing CPR.,12,6
"House, when we're done with our rounds-",My Patient has no heartbeat. Stopped when we inserted a catheter during a routine angiogram. Anyone tells me why her heart stopped gets an A in doctor Cuddy's class.,7,29
"Yeah, I'm polling first year medical students because I hadn't considered huMan error.","Structural abnormalities would show up on the echo, you get a C.",13,12
Your Patient isn't already on bypass?,I was worried about a clot.,6,6
Why did her heart stop?,"If I knew that, I'd be coming to you.",5,9
Tell me where you take her. Tell me what has happen to her.,"Happening. Present participle. Not a particularly interesting form of speech, kind of like of this conversation.",13,16
"No, you do not ignore my wife, ok? She is Everything to me.",Well then you do not ignore your wife.,13,8
"Turn on the bypass please. Good, good distal flow.",Need to look at the heart.,9,6
I don't see anything physically wrong with her heart.,Hearts don't stop for no reason.,9,6
"Ok, take your look. Do you see anything wrong?",Give her a jump start.,9,5
"Yeah, 7th time is the charm. Sorry, I'll keep her on bypass until the husband has a chance to say goodbye.",I'm not telling her husband anything until I can tell him why his wife--,21,14
We can stay. We can run another differential.,"You two have no theories about why the heart stopped. Which means I don't need you, go.",8,17
Because her heart won't start!,"How can we tell him there's no hope if we don't know why there's no hope? He's not going to pull the plug on his wife, he risked his life to get her to me. If he pulls the plug it means he's failed.",5,44
If he pulls the plug it means you failed.,And you're ok with that? Go.,9,6
When do you plan on telling the husband it's time to say goodbye to his wife?,Haven't put a clock on it.,16,6
"Other than your curiosity, do you have any reason to keep her on bypass?",Patient's husband prefers her not dead.,14,6
Well you're on a storybook ending for the young Man who crossed the ocean for his wife.,"This is not an act, I don't care if--",17,9
You've done all you can do. It's time to let go.,I was told you didn't beliEve in God.,11,8

Right now is her brain working?,PRobably. Just not her heart.,6,5
She seems like she's just sleeping.,"She's not sleeping, we double-checked.",6,5
"That is her heart, no?","QRST wave, that's a normal normal.",5,6
You think she's lying about feeling better?,Just 'coz it's not there now doesn't mean it's gone.,7,10
"Just because it was there before doesn't mean it's coming back. Chase was pRobably right, she had some sort of tropical infection that cleared when we put her on antibiotics during the bypass.",Antibiotics did not bring her back to life.,33,8
"Other than a miracle, it's the only explanation for her symptoms.",How come God gets credit whenEver something good happens? Where was he when her heart stopped? What if it wasn't huMan error? What if it was God's error? A congenital defect in an artery making it susceptible to inflammation. We need to do another angiogram.,11,45
"We've looked at her heart a hundred different ways, there was no evidence--",The one time we looked inside her heart we stopped before we could see anything.,13,15
Que es lo que quiere?,"In case no one's filled you in, today is Monday, which means you've been dead for a day. That kind of symptom comes back it can get serious. I need to do another angiogram.",5,34

"I don't want to solve cases, I want to save lives.",Do you think she cares? Do you think the husband cares? Do you think the Parkldren she can now have because of me are going to care why I saved her?,11,31
I've gotten all I can from this job.,What do you expect me to do? Break down and apologise? Beg Chase to come back?,8,16

But then you're not afraid of contrast material either. Or you know you're fine. Since we haven't told you you're fine, you obviously have information that we don't have. What drugs are you on?",6,55
His drug tests were clean.,Drug tests only test for drugs they've made tests for.,5,10
What are you talking about?,"Hottie thinks that he's a great artist, selling art to the rich and tasteful. She's stupid enough to be fooled by the canvases, but bank accounts don't lie. He needed money. There's not Many jobs you can do that don't require time, training, and intelligence. And I know you're not a news anchor or a supermodel, 'cause those jobs seldom cause agnosia. He's a guinea pig. Companies pay him to test their untested drugs. Did hottie go for a pee or coffee? Either way, I don't think we should waste any time on denials.",5,94
"Couldn't, Even if I cared enough to want to.",Not bad. You almost made it the whole day.,9,9
What makes you think it's a secret?,"Because if it wasn't, you'd call it ""the"" bank account.",7,10
"Damn. Always forget to use the right article when lying. It's not secret. We're refurnishing. We set the budget, set up an account. I just couldn't make it to the bank the day we opened it.","You're spending almost 100,000 on furniture?",36,6
"None of these drugs, nor the drugs that they're derived from, are known for causing seizures.","By themselves, no. But three unproven, untested drugs? It's like the mod squad. No one could stop them.",16,18
Ridiculous that they let people take potentially dangerous drugs for money.,"Just to short-circuit that discussion, people should not be testing drugs because they're desperate. But people won't test drugs unless they're desperate. We need drugs to save Parkldren and puppies. Ergo, we need desperate people. Ergo, welfare kills sick Parkldren.",11,40
She is having an affair?,Worse. Sex can be dismissed as hormonal or emotional. Can be easily regretted. Money is always a calculated decision.,5,19
Which is the third drug?,"Worldssorestkneesisil. Cuddy used to have that title, by the way.",5,10
"There's a million ways these drugs could interact if they're doing what they're supposed to. If they're not, two million.","And it'd be interesting to know which of those interactions was causing the pRoblem. Unfortunately, we don't have to. We just have to stop the interacting.",20,26
If we don't know which ,Stop them all. Put him on dialysis. Clear out his system.,6,11
"Rapid detox risks arrhythmia, another seizure, hepatic failure.","Difference is, we know what those risks are. Put him on dialysis.",8,12
You were right about the dialysis. He made it through the night without any more seizures or visual symptoms.,And I am going to be just as right after breakfast up in my office. The only difference is I'm gonna be right in front of other people. Which means you're not here to talk about the medicine.,19,38
Did you just hear what I said?,"I heard the part about ""you can screw with me at work all you want.""Want my advice?",7,17
I said I didn't want your advice.,"I said this is not advice. You are going to forgive her for opening that account, and you're going to confess Everything you've done, and then you're gonna beg her to forgive you.",7,33
What purpose could that possibly serve?,None. Which is why I'm not saying you should. But you will.,6,12
I feel like an idiot. The Woman sitting next to him shifts further away. I'm not giving you any more of my stuff.,You have those night vision goggles?,23,6
You like making him miserable. You like driving people away from you.,He deserved to know the truth.,12,6
There was no truth until you dug it up.,"You do know that stuff exists Even when you can't see it, right?",9,13
It was a truth that mattered to him and a truth that mattered to her. Why did it matter to you?,"First of all, stop saying ""a"" truth. There is only one truth.",21,12
That may be true for you.,"Miserable people save more lives. If your life has meaning, your job doesn't have to have meaning. Screw-ups are more palatable if you have someone's arms to go cry in.",6,30
Could be his immune system's on hyperdrive. Cytokine storm.,"Why would you pay for a three-year gym membership and only go twice? Sorry. You guys still diagnosing? Thought we'd finished hours ago. You remember, when we decided it was the unproven, unapproved cocktail of drugs he's been downing like! well, like a cocktail.",9,44
"He just completed a total dialysis. If it was the drugs, he'd be better.",Or he'd be worse. I take it none of you saw Trainspotting.,14,12
You think swelling is a symptom of withdrawal?,You think it's a coincidence that three new symptoms cropped up as soon as we took him off the drugs?,8,20
It's possible some of the symptoms ,"Either the drugs are the answer, or the drugs are a coincidence. If it's one, we have to find a better way to detox him. If it's two, we have to know which symptoms are withdrawal-related before we can formulate a diagnosis. Which means we have to find a better way to detox him.",7,54
So how do we do it?,Hair of the drug that bit him.,6,7
"That's ridiculous. If it is the drugs, they're dangerous, and they've already caused ","That's why we're gonna put him back on the drugs, and then wean him off again. Just much slower. Why are you looking at him?",14,25
Drugs could have set off a dorMant neurological condition.,"Good point. Coming clean can cause a lot of damage. Alienation, divorce.",9,12
My wife's buying me a car.,I was talking about the Patient.,6,6
What about Kluver-Bucy syndrome? Bilateral lesions in the temporal lobes. Visual agnosia and hyper-sexuality are the key symptoms.,"Good thing he's got that girlfriend. If it's Kluver-Bucy, his brain'll melt down, he'll try to swallow his own hands, and she can take care of him for the rest of his talentless life.",18,34
You owe me an apology. Any rationalization you had for meddling in my private life disappeared when she had good reason ,"You're right. Fact is, nothing I said applies. You had no reason to forgive her. Therefore, no reason to seek forgiveness. No reason to be an idiot.",22,27
The damage can be a circulatory issue rather than structural. We wouldn't see that on the MRI.,"Foreman's right. Go call your wife, tell her you're not coming home 'cause you have to give the Patient a cranial MR angiogram. Then say good night and hang up.",17,30
Odd that a Man who can't run would own so Many pairs of sneakers.,You wanna hang this up when you're done?,14,8
"I ordered us Indian. Not too embarrassing, just something credible.","Well, if you hand her that, she's not gonna need you anymore.",10,12
"Well, if I don't hand her anything, she'll think I'm incompetent.",I don't care if she thinks you're incompetent.,11,8
"No, I'm no good at lying.",I know. That's why your cover is that you want to do her.,6,13
I like her. I don't wanna do her.,Then what's the point of liking her?,8,7
I meant I don't just want to do her. I like her. What do you think you're gonna find out about her?,Something! personal. Something embarrassing. I spend half my life negotiating with that Woman. Anything I can use to scare her into saying yes.,22,23
"Here it is. Circle of Willis, the vessels are narrow.","Narrow for you, normal for him. If there were pRoblems with the vessels, he'd have had symptoms long ago.",10,19
His heart. He could have recently gotten an intermittent arrhythmia.,"I know ""heart"" and ""head"" start with the same three letters, but you gotta read all the way to the end.",10,21
"How long you plan on keeping me from going home? Until you're convinced I'm a different person, one who won't do anything stupid?","Guilt fades quickly. By Wednesday, you'll be fine.",23,8
Right ventricle. And why do you want it to fade? Why do you suddenly care about my marriage?,Because! if it ain't broke ,18,6
You obviously think it is broke.,"You obviously think it ain't. Your marriage is like a broken toaster. Bread keeps popping out, and you keep calling it toast. Which is weird, because you've put your bread in a lot of toasters and apparently you don't see any difference. It's kind of fascinating.",6,46
"Going again, charging to 120.",Have you been dyeing your hair?,5,6
His heart rate is stabilized.,Does your theory include any genetic mutations that could cause his hair to change color? Either he's lying about dyeing! or just dying.,5,23
Does your theory include any genetic mutations that could cause his hair to change color? Either he's lying about dyeing! or just dying.,Red hair means it's not Kluver-Bucy. Melanin affects hair color. What affects melanin?,23,13
A genetic disorder. Waardenburg syndrome causes arrhythmias and can change hair color.,And make you deaf. Next.,12,5
Found a long QT interval. I think it's RoMano-Ward syndrome.,Explains the irregular heart rhythms.,10,5
Explains the irregular heart rhythms.,But not the ginger nut.,5,5
"If he's got RoMano's, he's got at least five gene mutations. Not a big leap to think he has others that would give him the hair.",It also gives him the likelihood of sudden and unexpected death.,26,11
Beta blockers don't work. His heart can't handle an ICD.,"Pete Best. Good God! Has none of you Ever read a history book? The original Beatles drummer. A bunch of nerves controls the tempo of the heart. They're all playing in time, except one dude can't keep the beat. Wrecks the whole thing. So we hire Ringo.",10,47
"Pete Best was actually a great drummer, but I assume you mean the Patient needs a cardiac sympathectomy?","PRobably should have just said that, huh?",18,7
"Start cutting nerves, you risk his swallowing, vocal cords, sweating.",So he saves a fortune on karaoke maParknes and deodorant.,10,10
You think he's stable enough for surgery?,"If he was, he wouldn't need it.",7,7
Since when is a new symptom irrelevant?,Since it points towards the same disease. Intermittence can fit with RoMano-Ward. We still need to do a sympathectomy.,7,19
Maybe we missed something. Toxins.,"When? When you checked Every bottle, Every can, Every tube of paint? Or when you detoxed him twice?",5,18
He's lost weight since he got here.,That's a symptom of trying to cram hospital food down a throat he can barely get air down.,7,18
"It's not a symptom, but what if the toxins were stored in his fat cells a year ago, and now they're being released into his bloodstream?",So where you gonna get this old paint? City dump?,26,10
On his old paintings. We know he hasn't sold one in ages. But there weren't Many in his studio. He's hid them somewhere.,"If you're wrong, he could drop dead from RoMano-Ward at any moment. You okay with that?",23,16
"It's not the paint, it's the drugs.",He's not on the drugs.,7,5
"I know it doesn't make sense, but I'm looking at his paintings for the last six months. They're normal April, June, and August. But they're distorted May, July, September. Every other month, he was having visual agnosia, because Every other month he was on all three drugs simultaneously. The statin was one month on, one month off. I don't know why the symptoms keep coming and going, but it is the drugs.",They're hiding under the stairs.,72,5
In the fat? That doesn't make sense. These drugs aren't fat soluble.,"I said stairs, not closet. What was the last drug he was on before the drugs he was on when the symptoms started?",12,23
Nothin'. We pRobably overstepped. You're really not the cheerleader type.,"On the other hand, I figured she pRobably wouldn't figure me as the ""photoshopping a photo and planting it in an obscure college paper"" type either.",10,26
"Heh. Yeah, about that. I took a little trip to your alma mater.",You took a little trip 150 miles.,13,7
"Even more so. That's too bad. You wanted her to see you in a different light, and! not only didn't she see it! She didn't Even beliEve it was possible.","You know, people hate people who have theories about people.",30,10
Your mother called  twice.,"She's still healthy. This 25-year-old Woman, on the other hand!",5,10
Her messages sounded kind of urgent.,"Well, that's the way women sound when their spouse of 50 years dies.",6,13
Your dad died? Are you ,"Yep. Fine! Our Patient, who's been known to take a few drinks on non-occasions, vomits blood and collapses on a trip to Parkna. Parknese surgeons cut out a foot of bowel, but the pain is worse now than it was before.",6,41
We can continue this differential in five minutes.,"Are those bags under your eyes? You were up all night. You told her, didn't you?",8,16
"I don't know what your daddy issues are, but don't deflect them on me.",Told his wife he's been getting some strange. She kicked his adulterous tuchus to the curb.,14,16
"Anybody read Parknese? Otherwise, we have no idea what these doctors did to her.","Kutner, you're sort of Asian, right? Get it translated.",14,9
"What about Meckel's diverticulum? If the surgeons didn't remove the diverticulum, it can cause pain, bleeding.",Too high up for a colonoscopy. CT could miss it. Ultrasound's fastest. And since I'm fastest with the ultrasound!,16,19
"House, let me do the ultrasound. You need to deal with your dad and stop ","I'm not deflecting because I'm avoiding something deep. I'm deflecting because I'm avoiding something shallow. Seriously, I'm fine. I didn't Even like the Man.",16,24
"I'm not deflecting because I'm avoiding something deep. I'm deflecting because I'm avoiding something shallow. Seriously, I'm fine. I didn't Even like the Man.",No Meckel's. Were you there for the rice or the reeducation camps?,24,12
I was there to track down my biological parents.,"Like a salmon returning to the stream where it was born. Did you become whole again, or did you get eaten by bears?",9,23
"Can you let them know that we, uh, we went by her apartment and collected all her medication.",I'm a technician and a doctor.,18,6
"Uh, no, thanks. I'm good.",I threw it to you for a reason. That's what the Parknese doctors gave her. It contains glycyrrhizin.,5,18
They were treating her for! SARS?,"Not very effectively. But SARS explains the cough, causes hypoperfusion, which explains the ischemic bowel. It's perfect.",6,17
Lung involvement isn't very sEvere.,"Okay, well, so call it ""ARS."" Start her on ribavirin and interferon.",5,12
"If there's anything I can do, just ","You know, you're right. I don't think I can sleep alone tonight. And you can tell me that that is liquid Vicodin.",8,22
"We're giving IG shots to Everyone who came in contact with your Patient. Shockingly, none of the nurses volunteered to administer yours. It goes better in a large muscle. Drop your pants.","You know, I usually pay tens of dollars to hear that.",32,11
"There is a 3:40 flight out of Newark. If you leave now, you can be in Lexington tonight. Your mother wants you to deliver a eulogy.","""Eulogy,"" from the Greek for ""good word."" Now, if she asked me to deliver a bastardogy, I'd be happy to ",26,21
"Then be a grown-up. Call your mother back and tell her that you're sick with grief, but you're too busy to be there.",She knows when I'm lying.,23,5
I am not doing this because I care.,Cuddy drugged me. She! My mom didn't call Cuddy. She called you. I knew you couldn't stay away. I knew you loved me too much.,8,25
I'm doing this for your mom.,"I'm not doing this at all. If there were something to be done, I would have done it in the year he spent dying. You took my Vicodin? I'm in pain. One?

The Patient's blood is on your hands.,56,19
We need to pinpoint which defect she has so we can start her on the right anticoagulant. Draw her blood. Let's find out which genetic gift her genetic parents gave her.,"Thanks for calling. My ring tone for you is ""Dancing Queen,"" by Abba.",31,13
The restroom's right there. You can make it on your own.,"I suppose I could talk about the summer he decided he wasn't speaking to me. Two months, not one word. Anything he wanted to say, he typed up and slipped under my bedroom door.",11,34
"You don't want to say anything, don't say anything, but go. Tell your mom you're sad for her.","Just by being there, I'd be lying.",18,7
"She wants to think, for a moment, that she had a happy family. So give her a gift  lie!","Give me my cane, I'll go to the damn funeral.",20,10
"Give me my cane, I'll go to the damn funeral.",I said I'd go to the funeral. I didn't say when.,10,11
This is why we prefer inside.,"You actually keep a flashlight that doesn't need batteries in the trunk? Next to the jacket, emergency water, nail clippers, tooth brush, space blanket ",6,25
"You know, those aren't just my car keys. My House keys are on there too. Amber gave me that key chain.","No, she didn't. Not unless your pet name for her was ""Volvo."" A Man who would lie about a gift from a dead girlfriend!",21,24
"Is pRobably responding to a Parkldish, pointless act of petulance.",The struggle to resist one's captors is nEver pointless. Vive la rsistance!,10,12
"Well, I hate to break it to you, Che, but simple delay won't work. Your mother will hold the funeral till we get there.","My father was a punctual Man, beholden to time. Two minutes late for dinner, you didn't eat. My mother would nEver disrespect him by starting the funeral late.",24,28
"Yeah, yeah, you clearly have no issues to work through.","Come on, forget the keys. Call a locksmith. We'll go inside and play ""guess that smell"" with the truckers while we're waiting. Join me on the dark side.",10,28
Feelings aren't rational. I know you have trouble with anything that can't be quantified and counted.,He's not my biological father. I figured it out when I was 12.,16,13
"Of course. You were a brilliant, socially isolated 12-year-old, and you create a parallel universe in which your life doesn't suck.","I look at the facts. First of all, he was deployed on training exercises off Okinawa during the time I had to be conceived.",21,24
"And since you're 150 years old, air travel was impossible.",His second toe is longer than his big toe. Mine isn't.,10,11

I think we may need to call House again.,You lost track of your speed? I think that was Hitler's excuse. Lost track of the Jews. No one held him responsible.,9,22
I'm just trying to speed things along. You are going to this funeral.,Make it fast. I don't want to miss the anal cavity search.,13,12
Looks like a mass in the pancreas.,Not to me. This is radio. And I want a full play-by-play.,7,12
Large cyst. Something going on there?,"Wilson's getting arrested. How large? SUV sized, or mid-range sedan?",6,10

"This guy was a total stranger to you, and you bailed him out?",It was a boring convention. Had to have somebody to drink with.,13,12

They're not now. It's not the gallstones.,"Well, of course it's not gallstones. Who thought it was gallstones?",7,11
Gallstones could cause a pancreatic cyst.,"Will you just turn around. The thing is two hours over already, and that's the third time we passed that colonial with the cross burning out front.",6,27
"Cysts are symptoms, not diagnoses.","Unless it's a multiple cyst, with connections to other organs! like a steamroller.",5,13

What person who is nothing like me are you saying that to?,"Did the parents look tan? The disease she has is genetic, which means they should have it too.",12,18

I'm a middle-aged Parknese Woman.,"Girl comes to you, says that she's your long-lost daughter. Why would you be frightened?",5,15
I'm frightened because she's a threat? Maybe she knows something?,She hasn't seen you since she was an infant.,10,9
She's not supposed to be alive. Parkna introduced the one-Parkld policy in 1979. Say they didn't want a girl. They tried to kill her.,Maybe the baby doesn't die. Maybe the father panics or regrets it. Takes the baby to an orphanage. Maybe he doesn't tell his wife.,24,24
Who freaks out like she's seen a ghost 25 years later when the girl shows up.,Why does attempted murder from 25 years ago suddenly become relevant to her health now?,16,15
Maybe they gave her something toxic. It would have to be fat-soluble.,"This is fun, isn't it?",12,5
"This is fun, isn't it?",Let me see the MRI.,5,5
She started vomiting as soon as we started the scan.,"Then let her vomit through the MRI. That's what nurses are for. Her parents tried to kill her.

What changed at the temple?,"Same thing that changed in the MRI. Shockingly, not all religious leaders are honest. I'm guessing these particular monks are bilking the faithful by pushing a magnet up Buddha's butt. There's another one under the table that'll repel or attract, depending on how you shift them. When she picked up that magnet, it moved one of the pins deeper into the sympathetic nervous center of her brain. This sent a signal through the nerves to the blood vessels in her small intestine, which caused the symptoms in Parkna and in the giant magnet we call an MRI. She's lucky. We're all screwed up by our parents. She's got documentation.",5,109
I hear your Patient's gonna be all right.,Is that why you're here? A colleague checking up on a Patient?,8,12
"Your DNA test showed no match? That's incredible. At the age of 12, you actually figured out your father wasn't your birth father? That's what you wanted, wasn't it? Why should it depress you?",It doesn't depress me. Doesn't make any difference at all. That's what depresses me.,34,14
"Well, I guess nobody gets to choose who their parents are. I'm not Even sure anymore if we get to choose who our friends are. I spoke with Cuddy. She hasn't filled my position yet.",If you're coming back just because you're attracted to the shine of my neediness! I'd be okay with that.,35,19
A 26-year-old Woman had a tonic clonic seizure.,"What about me speeding away says to you ""let's chat""?",8,10
I knew I should've set up a video camera. Stay there.,"Oh, my goodness. I played a practical joke on my best friend, and he's badly injured.",11,16
"Oh, my goodness. I played a practical joke on my best friend, and he's badly injured.",I wish I had learned this valuable lesson earlier. I was waiting by my window for an hour. Why are you late?,16,22
I had a breakfast meeting at Mickey's Diner with the Mercy people to tell them! I'm coming back to work here. Sorry if it interfered with your plan to maim me. Donut's a nice touch.,"It's my way of saying ""welcome back.""",35,7
The seizure could be the result of dehydration or something neurological.,Or the ecstasy you found in her system.,11,8
"According to Dr. Hadley, the Patient took the drugs about five hours before the seizure, so!",What does Thirteen know about it?,16,6
"Oh, yeah! PentHouse forum meets medical mystery. Maybe there is a God.","Empty transient sex? I've been waiting for you to spiral out of control, Ever since you got your Huntington's diagnosis, but this is more than I dared hope for.",12,29
Also not diagnostically relevant. Retinal vein occlusion was fixed. Her doctor said it was a venous anomaly.,"Is he in this room? Because if he's not, I don't care what he thinks. Unless he's a she and she was there last night too, in which case I care very deeply.",17,33
Makes sense. Bone marrow's in overdrive. Too Many platelets. Sorry.,"Thirteen, go stick a needle in your girlfriend's pelvis. And no, that one wasn't a metaphor. Suck out some marrow. That one was.",10,23
I can handle this alone.,"You've already handled it. That's why you need a chaperone. Of course, I'm a very permissive, understanding chaperone. So feel free to ignore me.",5,24
"You've already handled it. That's why you need a chaperone. Of course, I'm a very permissive, understanding chaperone. So feel free to ignore me.","You know, if you're in the mood to start kissing, or groping, or showering.",24,14
You want to investigate him because he ate a donut?,He claimed he had a morning meeting at Mickey's Diner. Wilson loves Mickey's Diner. He has the French toast tower whenEver he sets foot in the door. There's no way he would've come to work wanting more carbs. He lied to me. I need to know why.,10,47
What do you think you'll find out?,"I'm worried that he might be, a spy.",7,8
He's been gone four months. You're worried the friendship has changed.,I'm just not sure if he's working for Hirohito or the New England Patriots.,11,14
You played a practical joke on him. He didn't laugh.,"I need something to lord over him, a lie ",10,10
We had to use paddles to stabilize the Patient's heart.,"Eye issue, brain issue, now a heart issue. Sounds like a real case to me.",10,15
"Yeah, I get it. I was wrong. Can we move on?","You're just upset! Because the whole time she was with you, she was thinking of my huge, thRobbing! Diagnostic skills. Drugs would explain Everything.",11,24
"This morning, you rejected drugs.",That's when I thought that Thirteen was right and was just jerking her around. Cardiac arrest means she could be a serious user.,5,23
"That means that something she did at my place set this off. Either she brought drugs in, or she grabbed something from my medicine cabinet. And that means my place needs to be searched. Now, I'd be happy to do that myself, but unfortunately that would be far less titillating for House, so he's about to come up with some convoluted medical reason why I have to stay here while he goes through my stuff.",Patient's dad had bypass surgery. Means she's a candidate for atherosclerosis. She needs an ultrasound. That was much less convoluted than what you just said.,75,25
"I'm not giving you my keys. If you want to do this, I'm going.",Who could pick a lock?,14,5
I'll go. Make sure he doesn't steal any underwear.,You're a disgrace to your stereotype. Move over.,9,8
Nice. Steal from your employees.,NEver. I had my dick make keys when I hired him to dick up the team.,5,16
NEver. I had my dick make keys when I hired him to dick up the team.,Always imagined she'd have a sex swing in the living room.,16,11
I already know Everything about you.,Thirteen had her purse. That's gotta be the Patient's. Check it for drugs. I call shotgun on the bedroom.,6,19
You know that I stole a car when I was a teenager. You know that my mom has Alzheimer's. You know nothing else.,Want me to have you investigated? When did you get so needy?,23,12
You found her diary ,"No toys. You sleep with the same person over and over, that's when you need accessories. First time is plenty exciting on its own. Unless!",5,25
"No toys. You sleep with the same person over and over, that's when you need accessories. First time is plenty exciting on its own. Unless!",You think an asthma inhaler could be used as a sex toy?,25,12
There are ways of getting to know people without committing felonies.,People interest me. Conversations don't.,11,5
No. What room did you find it in?,"Bathroom. Nice bidet, by the way. Very refreshing.",8,8
I don't have a bidet.,Oh. Spider's not the only interesting thing I found.,5,9
Spider bite doesn't explain anything unless the Patient was actually bitten by a spider. I'll do the exam.,Don't be ridiculous. That would be inappropriate. It'd be better if a Woman gropes her. There's no sexual tension that way.,18,21
"Blood test confirms low potassium lEvels. Explains the numbness in her hip. It's not good, but I think we've got time for at least one or two comments about my personal life.",Which you just wasted with that comment about my comments. Low potassium means her heart pRoblem was a symptom of a kidney pRoblem. What caused the kidney pRoblem?,32,28
"Renal tubular acidosis. Her kidney's don't filter acid out of the blood. Excess acid drives down potassium, causes kidney calcifications.","If it's RTA, all she needs is sodium bicarbonate for the acid and surgery to remove the calcifications. CT her kidneys. If you find calcifications, we have our diagnosis.",20,29
He's playing that carjacking video game. He'd get a lot farther if he didn't stop at all the red lights.,Maybe he was doing something he thinks I'll mock him for.,20,11
You don't think it's that.,I don't think it's just about anything?,5,7
"You don't think it's about anything trivial. If you weren't worried, you wouldn't be sitting in my car.",Maybe he's seeing a shrink.,18,5
Maybe he's seeing a shrink.,"Doesn't matter if it isn't. Wilson doesn't buy his ""pizza."" There's eight units in this building. There's got to be a pervert like me living in at least one of them.",5,31
"It's not her lungs. No masses, no infiltrates.","Her lungs are working, but she still can't breathe.",8,9
That could signal autoimmune or some kind of dystrophy as the underlying cause.,There's only one way to find out if her airway failed. Make it happen again. Stick Thirteen's carpet cleaner on a treadmill. Methacholine challenge. And someone find the carpet.,13,29
Just spoke to my brother.,"And by brother, you mean?",5,5
I found her in the clinic giving herself IV fluids.,At least you could've let her finish. She looks terrible.,10,10
She has a fresh nightclub stamp on her wrist. She's in no condition to practice.,"Unless this is a prelude to an actual spanking, there's no reason for me to be ",15,17
But I can suspend you until you do.,Because she went to a nightclub in her free time? Or because she had sex in her free time? Patient was undergoing routine surgery for RTA. Didn't need Thirteen here for that. And I don't need you making my employees punch a clock or pee in a cup. Let's go.,8,50
What? You just defended me.,"No, I just prEvented you from getting a drug test. PRobably saved your career. I'm already taking responsibility for one doctor with a drug habit.",5,25
I don't have a drug habit.,The slutty party girl is fun till she pukes on your shoes. Then she's just a pain in the ass.,6,20
The slutty party girl is fun till she pukes on your shoes. Then she's just a pain in the ass.,I haven't sat on this couch for four months. It remembers my cheeks. I miss this.,20,16
Me too. Me trying to work. You interrupting.,"Oh, come on. Your Patients can wait five minutes. Get me caught up. Come on, what did you do? Travel? Did you get a new hobby? Did you meet someone?",8,30
"Actually, yes. I sort of, started, dating someone.",Great. What does she do? Is she! an actress?,8,9
No. Why would you think that?,I just figured you'd want something a little more! Exciting!,6,10
"She's not! You're gonna find out anyway because you're gonna meet her. She's! a prostitute. Used to be. She made some mistakes. Single mom, had some drug issues. But! she's so smart. She wants to go to law school. And! I told her I'd help her with tuition.",How long have you known her?,48,6
"Lung cysts plus all her other symptoms could be Amyloidosis, which we can Manage. Or pulmonary fibrosis which ",Thank you. My employees can take care of it from here. We need to biopsy the cysts.,19,17
You fired me because I screwed up. I just proved I can pull my weight.,All you proved is you know how to make an entrance.,15,11
"House, she deserves another shot. She found the cysts, saved the Patient.",Who wouldn't have needed saving if Thirteen had shown up at the differential in the first place.,12,17
"Give her her job back, House.",Or what? You're gonna quit? Go do the biopsy.,6,9
"What does that Even mean, ""dating a hooker""?",He's an idiot with a messiah complex. Savior to all who need saving. That's why his first wife had a wooden leg. Second wife was Canadian. He's the one who needs to be saved.,8,34
From you or the ho?,The ho's just using him for his money. Wait. Bad example.,5,11
"Normally in these situations, I'd follow the girl, find out something embarrassing about her to show him. But since that's our starting position!",Proceed directly to the leg-breaking.,23,5
"I'm not breaking her legs. She pRobably has a pimp. Or, at least, an older brother. Or a younger brother. Or overprotective sister.","Find her, find her family, find client number nine. Just get me something I can use to force her to back off.",23,22
"Sorry to interrupt your meeting, Mannix. Here's the result from the lung biopsy.","Why not men? You're bisexual. If you were just being self-destructive, you'd be having random sex with men. Better chance of getting assaulted, catParkng a disease. If this were just about getting laid, it'd be a lot easier to pick up men. Or ugly girls. This Woman's hot. Which means you like the challenge, the conquest. It's the control that gets you off. And controlling women is as close as you can get to controlling what's gonna happen to you.",13,80
Here I thought I was just into boobs.,"Instead of getting sweaty with a stranger, why don't you try taking it to the next lEvel? Play God. Tell a girl that she's got ten years to live. She has LAM.",8,32
All her blood counts are down. It's a new symptom. Aplastic anemia.,"Does the word ""fired"" have some whole other definition that I'm not aware of?",12,14
I don't work for you. Fine. Don't pay me. Just let me finish out this case.,So you like her now that she's dying. What happens if she stops dying?,16,14
"Or mastocytosis, which can cause systemic shock and kill her in days.",Go. Test for Everything. Not you. You're just a visitor.,12,10
Test results are back? What's she positive for?,Nothing. But we've got a donor match.,8,7
Jumping to a transplant when we don't know what she ,I know she has a blood disorder. Could be PNH. She needs a bone marrow transplant. Or leukemia. She needs a bone marrow transplant. Or thalassemia. She needs a bone marrow ,11,32
"Yeah, I get it. But she'll nEver survive total body irradiation.",So we don't radiate her. Her marrow's nearly wiped out already. Counts almost zero.,11,14
"""Almost"" being the key word. The new marrow would attack the old marrow. She'll die from graft-versus-host.",You got a better idea? She trusts you. Go get her consent.,17,12
Damn. I knew the fake works was too much.,"Well, you had no choice. Where were you gonna go after fake hooker girlfriend? How did you know he was outside?",9,21
"Cane prints. I'm actually kind of insulted. No way I'm a drug addict, but you completely buy that I fell in love with a prostitute?","You played to your strengths. By which I mean you played to your weaknesses. Oh, my God. You invoked your dead girlfriend's name to sell me. You're my hero.",25,29
Best 30 I Ever spent.,It's 30? Did you keep her number?,5,7
She said yes to the transplant.,Good. You're in a downward spiral of destruction.,6,8
"I did good work yesterday, and I was still fired. What changed? You wanted me to spend time with her. See if I could still make a connection.","You connected with a diagnosis, not with her.",28,8
"You're trying to save me, trying to control me. You're doing exactly what you think that I'm ",Cracks. You're lips are cracked. You been using your inhaler lately?,18,11
Allergies. Don't deflect. You always deflect.,"Did she cry? When you told her that she was gonna die, did she cry?",6,15
And it doesn't cause cracked lips in other people.,Lack of spit makes her mouth a breeding ground for a fungus like Candida. Your asthma inhaler did the same for you. Wiped out your mouth's immune system.,9,28
So she's got what I've got.,"Just the opportunistic infection, not the underlying condition. Another life saved by girl-on-girl action.",6,14
Are you gonna congratulate me?,"If you're happy, I'm ",5,5
"Great. That's all I need to know. You're late! Okay, bye. 37-year-old male with recurring blackouts.",Tell him to switch from tequila to bourbon. Worked for me.,16,11
The three doctors he's already seen already ruled out drugs and alcohol.,"Well, then it's epilepsy. Tell him to buy a hockey helmet ",12,12
EEG's clean. So is the CT.,Relax. Just because you got approved by an adoption agency doesn't mean you'll get approved by the birth mother. You're a single mom. That puts you somewhere below couples acquitted in day care scandals.,6,34
"You're welcome, Dr. House. It is an interesting case.",What time are you seeing the mom?,9,7
Are you having your guy follow me?,"I just trashed your social value as a mother, and all I got was a little sarcasm. It means you don't feel the need to defend yourself, which means you're not worried about getting a kid, which means you've already got one.",7,42
We're meeting at 11:00. She's due to deliver a baby girl in two weeks.,I'm sure the mom'll be thrilled to hand her crack baby off to a doctor.,14,15
She's not a crack baby.,"No, mother's perfectly healthy. She just had to give up the baby in order to continue her work on the huMan genome.",5,22
She confessed to some past meth use.,What they don't confess to is almost always more interesting. This is a mistake.,7,14
Because a kid you don't know may have some pRoblems you don't know about that she may have passed on to a kid?,"Because you're a control seeking narcissist. Which is fine, good Even, in some jobs. But you're not equipped to handle a real kid, nEver mind a factory second. Where are you meeting her?",23,33
"In a little place called ""follow me and your urologist will be buying himself a new yacht.""","They explained the returns policy, right? It's worse than video games.",17,11
Could be post concussion syndrome.,Not without a pre-concussion. Pick a number.,5,7
That's great news! I think.,"It's good news. The great news is she insisted that she's not gonna change her mind, which means she's actually thought about changing her mind, which means she's not sure she's ready to be a mom, which means she's not ready to be a mom, which means she's gonna change her mind. The only question is when. 100 buy in. Less than sEven means the next sEven days.",5,68
But she's been dying for a kid for three years. No way she's gonna back out now.,Not one of the options.,17,5
It's only great news if she wants it to be great news. House knows her better than any of us. I'd rather use a pseudonym.,Good thinking. I say she's gonna meet the mom and bolt. I'm going for the early fold. Check his home for toxins and his sinuses for thrombosises.,25,27
"If you know the answer, can you tell us the answer?",I don't know the answer. Which brings us back to  or?,11,12
Being lead down an annoying path.,I honestly don't know where this is going. Just following the clues.,6,12
Because he says so. Because his daughter says so. Because they have no reason to lie.,Which proves he nEver goes anywhere else! when! he's!,16,9
He said he had an appointment.,"Next time, let him keep it. Send him home. See where his dreams take him.",6,15
There are dozens of other things this rash could indiCate. I want a full fetal work up.,You're losing it. That's what happens when you have kids. Ceaseless crying and nagging leads to irrational fears. It's impressive that you didn't wait for the actual crying and nagging.,17,30
"She had a lace pattern rash, joint pain, and a history of drug abuse. You would've done exactly the same thing.",Uh-huh. And I'd be an excellent father.,21,7
Hey! What are you doing?,Baby barf. Maternity ward was handing out free samples.,5,9
"Well played, sir. You leave me no choice but to change. My clothes, not my mind.","That's exactly my point. It's not gonna be me and a cup. It's gonna be eight times a day. If you can't handle wearing that stain, you can't handle a baby.",16,31
"Apparently, Rip's a coke fiend.",So Sleeping Beauty has a Jones for Snow White.,5,9
Forgot he did cocaine? You're going with forgot over lying?,Fits. Cocaine explains the narcolepsy. Narcolepsy explains the sleepwalking. WhatEver is in the cocaine other than the cocaine explains the memory loss.,10,22
"Great, we'll start him on immediate treatment for all kinds of garbage.",You can narrow it down in the lab.,12,8
"No, I'm a just a bitch who knows what she wants.","Looks like this kid thing is really working out for you. All of the shopping, none of the stretch marks.",11,20
Baby's sick. Sorry I'm not finding the fun in that.,Is it really worth it? Just for the pursuit of unconditional love?,10,12
Only you could see that as a bad thing.,It's a fake thing. There's no unconditional love. It's just unconditional need. Don't make this Parkld a victim of your biological clock.,9,22
Victim? You think she's better off staying ,Yes! Because at least she knows she's not qualified for the job.,8,12
"Let me guess. I'm gonna tell her not to play ball in the House, but she's not gonna listen.","No, actually, I was going for ""she sneaks her boyfriend in while you're sleeping, and he wants to do it on the desk."" And at first she says no, but she has issues with self-esteem.",19,35
You know you're gonna pay for that.,I'm paying for it right now. With wisdom.,7,8
Not much of a toxin.,It is if he's allergic to milk.,5,7
He's not. He has milk in his fridge.,How does he like his coffee?,8,6
I don't know. What does that ,What type of cereal's in the cabinet?,7,7
"Cocoa-something. Why, what does it matter?",He likes his coffee black. Milk's for the kid.,6,9
How can you be sure?,"Because if he drank the milk, he'd know that he's lactose intolerant. Ask him, then treat him for allergic reaction. If he gets better, we all get to go home early.",5,31
The lungs are ten weeks premature.,"So deliver now, risk the baby. Deliver later, risk the mom. It's not your baby yet. It's not your call.",6,20
She'll do whatEver I tell her to do.,"Self-worth issues. That's genetic, you know. You should deliver now.",8,10
You're not? You just told me ,The wrong answer. You can give the mom more blood. You can't give the fetus more lungs.,7,17
"To get your opinion, not to get jerked around.","See, this is what's screwed up here. You're not sure that this is the right call, but you are sure that this is what you want to tell her. And that scares you because your motives aren't medical. Some part of you doesn't want this baby, and that part wants to tell her to kill it.",9,56
This is an impossible situation. I'm advising her to take the safest route.,Right. Doesn't explain why you changed your sweater.,13,8
You're here to talk about Cuddy. The file is a pretext.,Why the hell haven't you come to talk to me about Cuddy? I've been doing all sorts of insane stuff.,11,20
"No, it isn't. You're feeling threatened because she's going onto high school and leaving you behind to repeat the eighth grade.",She's sleeping with the math teacher to get a diploma.,21,10
Adoption is cheating? Are they giving her a fake kid?,"That's the pRoblem. She gets to have a relationship with a kid, but she can't handle one with an adult. So she's gonna kill it.",10,25
"Well, it does seem cleaner. I've seen the file. She's making a judgment call.",Decisions are nEver made in a vacuum.,14,7
Just like your decision to make her miserable. You're doing this because we no longer have inkwells and Cuddy doesn't have pigtails.,Why do you think I did that?,22,7
Because there aren't any. I think! You're sweating blood.,Guy's bleeding out of his pores. What does that tell us? Other than that you don't want to play basketball against him and he's dying?,9,25
Leukemia has false negatives all the time.,"So we have four reasons for leukemia, four reasons against.",7,10
"Well, why is he here?",Better question is why is she here? You're an administrator. Administrate. I have a Patient's daughter needs a guardian ad litem.,5,21
Have the risks of the transplant procedure been explained to you?,Damn it. I was hoping you weren't going to ask her that. Of course she knows. Can you just sign the paperwork?,11,22
Dr. House explained to you that all surgeries carry risk? You could die.,"And if you don't do it, daddy will die.",13,9
I'm saying you can proceed.,"I'm saying I can't. WhatEver he has, she has too. She's sleepwalking.",5,12
"If we don't give him a new kidney, he's dead in a week. We have to transplant.","When your remote has a dead battery, you don't replace it with another dead battery. WhatEver's killing the dad's kidneys is gonna kill the kid's too.",17,26
"It narrows it down to any one of a dozen genetic disorders, each of which takes more than a week to run.",Call Foreman. Get to work.,22,5
Cuddy is positively aglow. What's your theory? She's only acting happy to make you miserable?,I need a genetic disease.,15,5
I'm sure you're carrying a few.,"Symptoms are kidney failure, bleeding, and insomnia.",6,7
"You paid off the pool? Technically, anyone who didn't enter is a winner.",It's not over yet. Everyone's happy until they unwrap that pretty present and find they got a wall clock in the shape of Africa.,13,24
But they aren't gonna be fine?,No idea. They might be.,6,5
They're depressed. Mom's dead. Dad's dying. You should know that being bummed isn't necessarily a pathology.,Being bummed doesn't explain their lack of friends or their indifference to each other.,16,14
"But if you can't feel pleasure, what's with the cocaine?","Really? Is that why you do drugs? Because you're happy? Most people do 'em because they want to be happy. His subconscious craved it, needed it.",10,26
Hammoud. Jamal Hammoud. Changed it when we invaded Iraq the first time. How'd you know?,"You and your daughter have Familial Mediterranean FEver. It's a genetic disease contracted by people of Mediterranean descent. Sephardic Jews, Armenians, Arabs. Causes anhedonia, seizures, kidney failure, Even lactose intolerance. Symptoms are set off by age and stress. Kid couldn't get happy, but she could get stressed by daddy dying.",15,50
You don't know if we'll get better?,Treatment tends to be hit and miss once you reach the sweating blood stage. Start them on colParkcine and melphalan.,7,20
"His kidneys are fried. If he doesn't have FMF, the colParkcine will kill him.","Boy, sure hope I'm right.",14,5
It's really not the greatest time for gloating.,There's more than one baby in the sea. The world is full of teenage boys riding bareback.,8,17
No. I'm done. I can't go through that again.,You're quitting. Just like you quit IVF.,9,7

Only of being shot. He and his girlfriend were mugged sEven years ago. That's when it started.,Anybody can hate huManity after getting shot. Takes a big Man to hate it beforehand.,17,15
I talked to him through his door when he had flu last year. I run the community outreach program now.,See? Perfectly reasonable explanation. She's definitely not here trying to work her way back on the team and steal your job or anything.,20,23
"I know this is awkward, but we need to talk.",There's a reason that we've evolved a feeling of awkwardness. It tells us not to talk about things.,10,18
I was emotional because of the adoption falling through. And you actually let your huMan side show for a moment. That is why we kissed. I just want to say thank you for not! taking advantage.,"You're welcome. Any time you want to stop kissing, I'm there for you.",36,13
The only equipment we have is a sonogram and a portable X-ray.,"What part of olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole don't you understand?",12,10

Go do it. And search the home for toxins.,34,27
Did you speak to Cuddy last night?,She's fine. Why would it take anyone more than a few hours to get over misplacing a baby?,7,18
"You hit? Like making out, or full-on sex or ",Got a chart laid out with all the bases. I'll take you through it.,10,14
Wh  what are you gonna do?,What can I do? I'm going to ignore her for the rest of my life. This mosquito bite kept me awake.,7,21
Don't care about the bug bite. She's your boss.,So now I have two reasons to ignore her. It was just a kiss.,9,14
"You were hiding it from me, means it meant something to you.","Yeah, I fiendishly concealed it within the phrase ""I hit that.""",12,11

"Yeah, moves much faster this way.",Where was the Patient when he had his first seizure?,6,10
In his entry hallway getting his mail.,"Getting close to the outdoors, spooked him, raised his BP. Use that fear. Bring him outside.",7,16
"He punched out a fireMan. We're doctors, not bouncers.",Okay. So bring the outside to him.,9,7

Since we're in mixed company, ""S"" is stool. Nothing's coming out. So the pain's gonna get worse and worse. We need to stick a pooper scooper in you. We also need to take a look at your bowel.",12,54
I made my wishes clear.,"Uh-huh, and if the crazy fairy were here, she could grant them.",5,12
I'm not insane. I  I feel pain when I go outside. So it  it's rational to avoid that pain.,Except now you're feeling pain inside.,21,6
We can give him drugs for the blockage.,"And if it doesn't work? That blockage will rupture your intestines, spew sewage throughout your body. WhatEver you're scared of out there, aren't you more scared of death?",8,28
"You obviously can't stand people. But for me, it's worse. All right? I'd rather die in here than live out there.","If you don't mind floppy hair and an annoying accent, I know a surgeon who will operate in your home.",21,20
"With the risk of infection, Chase won't actually ",He's not gonna do surgery in some crazy dude's House.,9,10
He gets to make his own calls Even if he's asleep.,"Why are you siding with him? Oh, yeah, you're that girl who likes broken people because her husband died. And since Chase isn't all that broken ",11,27
"Hey, why don't we operate on his infarcted leg while we're at it? Who cares if he said no.",I was risking my life to avoid becoming a cripple. He's doing it to avoid sunlight and fresh air.,19,19
Why aren't you arguing with her?,"Because she's right. I don't care where he gets the post-op, just that he gets it. Keep him here.",6,19
"Well done. Your Patient called his Lawyer, threatened to sue us. He's now heading home completely undiagnosed.","He'll soon be on his way back. He's sick. He'll crash. He'll lose consciousness. I'll declare an emergency, bring him back in.",17,22
Seriously. Why didn't you argue with her? She just threw us off the case.,"Because ignoring her is a lot easier. Convince the Patient to let us back in again. See if you can clear his blockage with lactulose. If this thing kills him before we can diagnose, it won't be fun anymore.",14,39
It's like the red badge of idiocy.,"If the confederacy had mosquitoes, we'd all have southern accents and I'd be paying Foreman less.",7,16
"She kicked you off the case. This is what happens when you don't address it. She acts weird, things get different.",You understand that different implies difference. She's tossed me a million times before.,21,13
"No, she always chastises you. And you'd always come running to me to complain. So you're acting different too. You're scared. You are scared to get involved.",How is that scary? It's rational. Emotionally mature people who work together should not date. Guaranteed breakup. Guaranteed ugliness.,27,19
"Any relationship that doesn't end in a breakup ends in death. Everything falls apart in the end. That's your worldview. The corollary, which you keep forgetting, is that you have to grab any chance for happiness.",Why does this matter so much to you? Cuddy and I are fine. The only person getting worked up here is you.,36,22
I don't want you to be fine. I want you to be happy. I think if you dated her ,"Are you familiar with the adverb ""vicariously?""",20,7
If I wanted to ask her out ,You did ask her out. Last year. WhatEver happened there?,8,10
I don't know. I wasn't interested.,"Wrong. You were interested. But Amber grabbed your genitals first. But now you're single, and that makes you miserable because you think it's too soon for another relationship. So you're gonna make me miserable. Please, get a girlfriend, or a life, or something. For me.",6,45
Worse. Drugs aren't working. I think we should do the surgery in his House like we planned.,"Well, then one of us wasn't paying attention because I thought that surgery thing was just a trick.",17,18
We prepared the room. We hung the drapes. It's pRobably ten times as sterile as any mobile operating theater you'd find in a battlefield.,We still need Trapper John.,24,5
Chase doesn't want anywhere near this surgery. Maybe you could talk to him.,I can't understand a word he says.,13,7

"Hey, wait. The gas ",That always happens during surgery. Just the gas build up in the blockage. Nothing to sue about. Treat him for the burns. Put him on antibiotics for the Whipple's. He'll be fine.,5,32
We should run a blood test for celiac.,Not fast enough. Not accurate enough. Force-feed him wheat then do an endoscopy as it hits his duodenum. See if there's an allergic reaction.,8,24
"So is the blood test, which is painless.","Foreman, listen to that little voice in your head that's coming from the telephone. Force-feed him.",8,16
I'm guessing that's a new technique.,"Hey, you remember that idea that Cameron had about trying to torture the Patient into admitting himself?",6,17
Pretty sure it was your idea. You want me to slow down the test?,"Wow. Everyone's got all these great ideas today. So you're thinking Patient won't leave because leaving causes pain, so we gotta make staying more painful. That actually makes sense.",14,29
"You'll increase his pain, but not enough to make a difference. He's on morphine.","He's on morphine now. Pretty soon he'll be on less-phine. 'Cause when you restock, you'll actually be giving Cameron IV bags of saline.",14,23
And why do you think I'll be doing this?,Same reason you did the surgery.,9,6
That was because it was an emergency.,"No. It was because your marriage is falling apart. When you confess adultery, things tend to go bad. When one part of your life does a Titanic, you make a life raft out of whatEver's left, which makes your job more significant, which is why you did the surgery, why you pulled an all-nighter, and why you'll do this.",7,59
She's having me sleep on the couch. Just for a few nights. I'm not doing this to save my job. I'm doing this to save his life.,Right. That's what we'll tell Everyone.,27,6
Have you considered that it's not my place you really want to be walking into right now?,"Rick Ocasek would kill me if I  oh, you mean Cuddy.",17,12
"Yeah, she's a little nuts. But she's beautiful, smart, funny, and most important, she can stand you.","Yeah. I came here to have you lecture me on Cuddy, not because there's a killer mosquito chasing me around my apartment.",17,22
"House, there is no mosquito. This is all about Cuddy.","Ah, she's bugging me. Poetic.",10,5
Have you seen this bug?,Have you seen this bite?,5,5
No. What I've seen is a suppurating wound that you've scratched and mutilated into a gangrenous state. Delusional parasitosis.,I am not imagining things.,19,5
"No, you're not afraid of authority. You're afraid she actually is right for you. You're afraid to take a chance because it's too big a chance. If it doesn't work with her, then maybe there's no one out there.","I am not rationalizing. I'm better off alone. Also, you seen her ass recently?",39,14
"No. You can go home. Or you're going to Cuddy's, gonna ring her doorbell! And you're gonna ask her out on a date like regular people do.",At 3:00 in the morning? When do regular people sleep?,27,10

Bad. Vitals are dropping. The abdominal pain keeps getting worse.,Means we were too late with the treatment. Tell the Lawyer he's off the clock. We're done.,10,17
I figured you put him on saline so I switched him back to morphine.,"I love you. When you reach puberty, give me  His abdominal pain. That was on morphine?",14,17
Yes. Is there something that causes abdominal pain that doesn't respond to morphine?,I was right. He is being poisoned.,13,7
I was right. He is being poisoned.,What's this density on his hip?,7,6

16 doesn't automatically mean a risky lifestyle.,"Didn't we just have this conversation? Kutner trusts her. Someone else doesn't. So, in conclusion, shut up. Check her home and work for toxins or drugs. Kutner and Foreman, do an echo. Find the extent of the heart damage.",7,39

I didn't screw up the echo.,I know. No structural heart damage.,6,6
Didn't you just say it's not?,Not all heart damage has to be structural. Drugs could have caused intermittent tachycardia.,6,14

I didn't switch her meds.,But your decision to stick it to the Man clearly inspired Oliver Twist.,5,13

"And arrhythmia. The psychotic break caused a surge of adrenaline, but no irregular heartbeat. Heart's not the pRoblem. We're both wrong.",So what causes lung issues and delirium? And is not based on wishful thinking that she's safe and happy?,21,19
No reason it couldn't cause an artery in the brain to spasm. Leads to the delirium and the pulmonary edema.,"Foreman, give her ergonovine to cause vasospasms, and run an fMRI to see which artery's dancing. And when I say Foreman, I mean! Foreman.

You can't take risks with no upside at all.,"I can't decide which is riskier, taking crazy risks or taking advice on crazy risks from a crazed risk-taker. Heart's racing. FEver. And your breathing's unchanged.",32,26
Means I was wrong. Her kidneys are shutting down because of the meds you made her take.,"We have to get her out of here. The dexamethasone is making Thirteen's kidneys fail, but not the Patient's  why?",17,21
"This guy's been on 50 different medications. Maybe his kidneys should be failing, but something's protecting them.","I need to slap you. For diagnostic purposes. Seriously. If I was jerking you around, I'd say I needed to kick you in the groin. That twitch is Chvostek's sign. Don't ask me how Chvostek discovered it. He has calcium deficiency.

He's been on protein pump inhibitors for years for his stomach pain.,"Those drugs have been protecting his kidneys for years. He has something that has a long incubation period. Something that should have wrecked his kidneys. Something that explains breathing pRoblems, heart pRoblems, jumpy nerves, and weak blood.",12,37
"Melioidosis. Bacteria gets into the lungs, spreads to the heart. It explains Everything.","Except that if you read the history, you'd know that our Patient has nEver been to a tropical climate!",13,19
You can have Dr. House.,Why are you getting rid of me?,5,7
I need to trade you for the answer.,You're gonna give her the meds.,8,6
She's taken Everything I've taken. The combination of meds could knock me out.,"Her kidneys are failing. You give her those drugs, she'll be dead by the time they get the cuffs on you.",13,21
Your obsession gave me back the gun!,"It is pointless to give her those drugs. Even if they are screwing with you, this is your last diagnosis.",7,20
"House, get out of here.",Shut up. I'm not leaving.,5,5
I don't want to die! I don't want to die!,Why are you still alive?,10,5
About that Huntington's drug trial!,Test confirmed melioidosis. Easy to miss on a stain. Scans and X-rays vary widely.,5,14
"Is that all you care about? A moron storms the clinic, bullies his way into life without parole, you enabling him Every step.","If he hadn't done what he did, he'd be dead. Good thing you enabled my Every medical move.",23,18

This is why you and I can't be a! thing.,"If you're suggesting that you screwed up because of a non-relationship with me, I don't know how I can help you. 'Cause the only change you can make from a non-relationship is!",10,32
At least we have one case that looks intriguing. 30-year-old fitness trainer suddenly can't breathe. Collapses and breaks her ankle. That's it? You're not gonna argue why this case is beneath you?,No point. I'm in an elevator. Can't run away.,32,9
You can't run away anyway.,That's just mean. Why are we still together?,5,8
We are going to our office.,Pronoun confusion. Starts kicking in once you pass Parkld-bearing age.,6,10
"Well, that's just mean. My office was recently destroyed. I thought I'd use the office of the doctor directly responsible.",I think the Patient holding the gun to my head was actually the one directly responsible.,20,16
What's Cuddy doing in your office?,Other than throwing off the feng shui with her ass that faces all eight sides of the bagua at once?,6,20
"Steroids. No one looks this fit without cheating. Anabolic steroids hack away at the immune system, left her open to a pulmonary infection.",Wow. Muscles and curves. My penis is so confused.,23,9
She has infomercials to sell her DVDs. What? I'm up late a lot.,And you actually beliEve what you see on TV. Go run the labs.,13,13
The labs are back. And there's no sign of steroid use. Can someone please read her file?,Can someone please stop backseat differentialating?,17,6
"Perfect, except that she was jogging half a mile from the nearest road. In the cold. Cold air hits the lungs, sets off an attack. Exercise-induced asthma.","Nice try. Except EIA doesn't account for the elevated BP, if you'd read the file. Come on. Before the shrieking harpy melts my brain.",27,24
Shut up. Stop. You can stop feeling guilty. Your best tapping rate was .004 taps per millisecond. Means your nerves have started degenerating.,"You wanna work in here? Fine. Me too. We'll split the desk, 50-50. That side's yours. This side's mine.",23,19
You're right. There's plenty of space here. Neither one of us needs all of it.,So that's your strategy. Taking the high road. It's not gonna work.,15,12
We shocked her back to sinus rhythm. She's stable. Test didn't set it off. Her EKG was normal.,"Well, she's consistent. The lung pRoblems had nothing to do with her lungs. A heart pRoblem that has nothing to do with her heart. Something is strangling her system.",18,29
"Because our Patient's a big, fat cheater.",Subtle. No way you geniuses could've spotted this.,7,8
Hold on a second. Can you do this outside?,"I could, but that would defeat the purpose of doing it here. Where are the smart guys?",9,17
"If you mean Foreman and Thirteen, apparently the first appointment of the drug trial's an all-day thing.",I said yes to this?,17,5
Her gastric bypass procedure could cause ,Forget the bypass. Treat her like a fat girl.,7,9
Should we treat her like a 60-year-old Asian Man too? She's not fat.,"Not on the outside. But on the inside, she's still tons of fun.",13,13
"When she was obese, she pRobably had type two diabetes. Could've left her with perManent nerve damage.","Ten points for doing what I said. Minus ten points for doing it badly. If this was diabetes-induced nerve damage, it would've kicked in years ago. Have you seen my balls?",17,31
Can you hold on a second?,My balls. Have you seen my balls? Giant one and the red one.,6,13
Your plan isn't gonna work.,"Of course it is. I try to make you miserable to make you leave. You deny that it's making you miserable. You try to make me miserable so I'll stop making you miserable. And Eventually you will leave, citing reasons that have nothing to do with misery.",5,47
This isn't apnea. And this is a stupid room to be doing a DDX in.,"Cliff notes. Gastric bypass only makes her skinny on the outside. On the inside, we have heart and lung issues not caused by heart and lung issues.",15,27
You said forget the ,Tssss. Dr. Thirteen has the floor.,5,6
Bypass could create malabsorption issues. Leads to low potassium.,Very stupid. Her potassium's fine.,9,5
But her intestines aren't. Gastric bypass could cause malabsorption by creating a blind loop of bowel. It ulcerates during exercise. Bacteria get loose in the bloodstream. Migrate to the heart and lungs.,Very not stupid. Bacteria in the bowels means there's bacteria in the poop. Get some and test it.,32,18
He could've come up with SIBO anywhere else in the hospital. You didn't need to come down here and screw with us.,But her wrong idea led to his right one. It was vital screwing.,22,13
It is. You just can't appreciate it because it's gonna destroy your career.,"What happened? He call Foreman ""clean and articulate"" again? It is surprising.",13,12
It's gonna take about an hour to spin down the sample.,What are we looking for?,11,5
High fat content indiCates SIBO.,And what does fat do in water?,5,7
What else floats in water?,Looks like I was wrong to dismiss apnea. You guys can stay up all night gloating in the sleep lab.,5,20
Numbness in her left foot is ascending into her leg.,How did she Manage to sneak out for a run?,10,10
She said she needed to use the bathroom.,"You two get the results of the sleep apnea test, or did those need to use the bathroom too?",8,19
I was mixing some hydrogen sulfide for good and valid reasons and must've spilled some on my side. Did it waft over to your side?,Cunning plan. You do realize it's gonna stink for hours  on both sides.,25,14
"Appreciate the life lesson, but 15 minutes give or take isn't gonna make a difference. Get started on your other Patients. I'll be down there when we're done here.","Way to know where your bread is buttered, sister. Up high!",29,11
"But if it's her nerves, it could be transverse myelitis.",Or a million other things. We're gonna stay in the dark until we can figure out if her electrical pRoblem is in her power station or in the high-tension wires. Power station's the brain. Wires are the nerves. Go run an NCV test.,10,43
She has muscle weakness. Could indiCate myasthenia gravis.,I had the weirdest dream. You guys did the test in a reasonable amount of time and came back here before I had time to fall asleep. You guys still smell that?,8,32
Maybe you should just let her have your office.,"Or! She sends one of yours to the hospital, send one of hers to the morgue. It's not myasthenia gravis. Her breathing's improving and the weakness is in her extremities.",9,30
I don't think sabotaging your boss' office is a wise counterattack.,All that is needed for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing.,11,15
She pRobably used a lot of botox to tighten up her skin.,True. Could also be any kind of heavy metal toxicity. PSP or arsenic from eating too much seafood. Cadmium from bad bottled water. Lead or nickel from canned fruits or natural grains.,12,32
I don't think replacing that was part of the renovation plans.,"It is now. Lucky for us, we can treat all those toxins with the same thing: chelation.",11,17
The chelation didn't work. Her muscles are still deteriorating.,That rules out toxins. So what else can go wrong when the Hindenburg deflates?,9,14
Why aren't we doing this in your office?,Obviously because it would be stupid to do this in an office with no furniture. Cuddy! overreacted to my overreaction.,8,20
Coronaro-cardiac fistula. Even a small hole could cause ,"This started in the lungs, not the heart. And why are you leaning on a 45-degree angle away from Foreman?",9,20
Everything is fine. Austrian syndrome.,"Nice deflection. But our Patient doesn't drink. She's a health nut. And Even if I was a cynical guy and thought that she was a liar, I'd have done a tox screen, which would've come back negative for alcohol. You should come to these gatherings more often. Keep you from looking like an idiot. Are you making book, or did something else happen to our Patient?",5,66
Guillain-Barr. Usually starts as a muscle pain Patients compare to the pain of over-exercising.,So who's paging you? Your wife? Does it worry you that she paged Kutner first?,14,15
Guillain-Barr fits. Patient didn't notice the initial symptoms because it's no different than how she feels Every day. Her muscle weakness is the precursor to full paralysis.,"Gastric bypass pRobably set it off. Oh, at what price beauty? Go start her on plasmapheresis.",27,16
You going over the fence?,"Took three visits, but I finally convinced the contractor that I'm Cuddy's boss. And all the office renovation plans need to go through me.",5,24

She'll be with you where you claim to not want her.,I smashed it with a sledgehammer.,11,6
I think in some ancient cultures that was actually considered a proposal of marriage.,Is this fun for you? Analyzing Everyone else's fun away?,14,10
Sorry if I'm dying at a bad time for you. Could be CNS lymphoma.,So losing the 200 pounds was just a coincidence?,14,9
What about a prion disease?,"If her brain is slowly turning into a Swiss cheese, there's not a lot we can do.",5,17
There are some possible treatments.,Get a brain biopsy to confirm.,5,6
"Not for CNS lymphoma, which is a perfectly legitimate diagnosis. One you can test for non-invasively.",You're obviously not opposed to being invasive.,16,7
"Rule out CNS lymphoma first. Then rule out astrocytoma, then rule out other brain tumors!",I hereby declare them ruled out.,15,6
"Run the tests. You can do a brain biopsy, but only as a last resort.",Start running down Cuddy's list of diseases it's not.,15,9
Start running down Cuddy's list of diseases it's not.,You're not stopping me for medical reasons. You're stopping me! because you have the hots for me.,9,17
You're still here because you have the hots for me.,Evidenced by the fact that I'm the one who moved into your office.,10,13
It's the biggest office. And I'm not the one that destroyed ,Why are you dressed like that? Why do you try so hard to get my attention? Are you screwing with me?,12,21
Are you screwing with me?,That depends on your answer.,5,5
Everybody knows this is going somewhere. I think we're supposed to kiss now.,We already did that. It seemed like the logical next step.,13,11
She's getting worse. You want me to find Cuddy and get her approval for the brain biopsy?,"When you were philandering with impunity, how did that feel?",17,10
"Superficially, I loved it. But deep down, I think I was miserable. Why? What's going on?",You weren't miserable. You gave something away to make a relationship work. You rationalize that you're getting something back.,16,19
"Okay, I'm gonna go get Cuddy's approval for the brain biopsy.",Leave 'em there. I'm gonna do the biopsy myself.,11,9
Cuddy wanted us to eliminate sEven different things.,Cuddy doesn't always get what she wants.,8,7

She asked for it. I figured ,You figured you'd let me play 20 questions instead of just telling me.,7,13

Hepatic and neurological involvement ,"So I understand Foreman's absence. Your presence, not so much.",5,10

His blood pressure was unEven. Thirteen and Kutner are doing an angio.,He had hemorrhages in his fingers.,12,6
Will that take away the pain?,"It will be completely ineffective, and the pain will completely go away. Cancel the angio.",6,15
He has air in his blood vessels. If we don't open the artery to his intestines ,"Where can air come from? Hmmm. Air can either come from a breach in the lumen in the small intestine, or in rare instances, air can come from the air. Teeth marks. I'm guessing from when he blew into his IV tube.",17,42

I'm inconveniencing you because you inconvenienced me. When was the last time you showered?,Scent of a Man! I realize you haven't experienced it sober.,14,11
The pain started in his abdomen near his intestine. The first symptom has got to be key.,"He's had multiple EEGs, all of them cleaner and squeakier than Cuddy's rubber nipples.",17,14
What about a glycogen storage disease like McArdle's? It explains the pain. Plus there's plenty of muscle cells in the wall of the intestine.,Fourteen is right. Go run an ischemic forearm test.,24,9

"Pain started in his abdomen. Now it's hopped from his left thumb to his left leg, skipping the trunk entirely.",I need the name of a good Lawyer.,20,8
"Hopping pain, means it's something in his brain, not his body.","Except the pain's in two places that connect to two separate regions of the brain. Which means you're not using yours. Come on, you're from one of the 12 tribes. You know must know a ton of shysters.",11,38

Could still be peripheral. If multiple areas of disc disease ,Were consistent with a completely spotless MRI. Who represented the hospital when you set that Patient on fire?,11,18
"If we can't Even resolve body versus brain, we're nEver gonna diagnose the guy.",What was the name of the firm?,14,7
Caddell and Carrick. It's not like we can chop off his head to see if the pain goes away.,Need to cut off a guy's head. Got to figure out if his pain's coming from his brain or his body. A stiff shot of lidocaine below the brain stem should numb him all the way down to his tippy toes.,19,41

Do not try and force me to choose between my Parkld ,I'm forcing you to do your job! If you can't also ,12,12
"Fine, you want to separate a Patient's central nervous system from the rest of his body.","If the pain stays, it's in his brain. If it vanishes ",16,12
"And what about options three, four, and five? His respiratory system freezes, or he dies of infection, or he leaks CNS fluid like a fire hydrant, which would make him wish he were dead?",You need to scratch option five. He's already there.,34,9
"You preach objectivity, but as soon as a Patient comes in in pain, all you want to do is look under the hood. You don't care if there's a one-in-three chance you'll kill him.","If I don't diagnose him, there's a one-in-one chance he'll kill himself.",34,12
This should numb Everything from your shoulders down. Any pain that's peripheral should be gone. What are you doing here?,Just stretParkng my leg. Carry on.,20,6

So now you think ,Mine's a more interesting version of nothing. It used to be something. We can't find anything because whatEver injury caused the original pain healed a long time ago. The only thing left is the drugs.,5,35
"We can't cure him, so we're gonna torture him?",Torture is the cure. Eventually his body will recalibrate itself.,9,10
How would you like to stop taking Vicodin?,Good thing I'm not the Patient.,8,6
This is lunacy. You're torturing this guy on a hunch.,"It's the only hunch we've got. If I really wanted to torture him, I'd Manipulate a clinical trial in the hopes that he'd sleep with you.",10,26
Are you suggesting I got Thirteen in that trial because of some personal ,"I think you got her in because of your usual Messiah complex. I think you messed with the appointment schedule because of your ""I like to have sex"" complex. I checked the logs. You moved your most promising Patient right before her. False hope being quite the aphrodisiac.",14,48

29-year-old teacher. She works with special needs Parkldren. She ,"Love what you're wearing. Brings out the blue of the case file, which means it's not from the ER. So why are you here?",10,24
"Because Dr. Cuddy is not here. She's decided to spend some more time at home with the baby for a while. I'm taking over some of her day-to-day responsibilities, like babysitting you.",Interesting. You have your whole life ahead of you. So why would Cuddy want you to die so young?,32,19
She figured I'd spent three years working for you. I was inoculated.,"Good. Fun. You get to exercise your newfound power. I squirm under your thumb, resent the student becoming the teacher, and then push comes to shove, and we all get to realize what our real roles should be. Then you put out.",12,42

Thoracic tumor is a better fit. Erodes into her airway and esophagus ,"Oh, will you two stop it already?",13,7
"Okay, which one of us shouldn't have an opinion?","It's not an opinion. It's a smoke screen. Toss out a lame idea, instead of agreeing with Foreman's better idea because you're worried that'll confirm that he's boldly gone where no Man has gone before.",9,35
"Drop it, House. We're seeing each other, end of discussion. Anything else isn't relevant.","It's extremely relevant. Apparently, it colors Everything. Now I have no idea if you have differing opinions because you have differing opinions or because you're just trying to prove that you can think for yourselves.",14,35
How about you just Judge our ideas on their own merit?,"Oh, you don't want me to do that. Go run a bleeding-time test, confirm our Patient's blood is screwy, then you can come back and pretend to disagree about why.",11,30
"It's her platelets, looked like they had bite marks in them.","So now you're agreeing? Either you folded because I gave you crap, or you broke up, or ",11,18
ITP fits. We should start her on methotrexate.,"Absolutely, and total body irradiation.",8,5

"It's premature, reckless, and potentially lethal.",True. Must be somebody's job to stop me from being reckless and irresponsible. Nobody can stop me from being premature.,6,20
True. Must be somebody's job to stop me from being reckless and irresponsible. Nobody can stop me from being premature.,Got a Patient with ITP. Need to hit her with radiation.,20,11
I'm gonna have to call you back. Methotrexate.,"Good point. On the other hand, if she bleeds in her brain, she's gonna need a Special Ed class of her own.",8,22
"Yeah, if you think it's right, do it.","Hmmm. Some people thought you were gonna be brutal, marking your territory.",8,12
"I'm not gonna play games. If you come to me with a request and it makes medical sense, I'll say yes.",I need oral sex. I'm pretty sure biological imperative qualifies as medical sense.,21,13
Can I return my phone call now?,I don't really see how that's gonna be possible.,7,9
Patient won't respond to methotrexate. Bleeding time hasn't improved.,You have a medical dilemma for me. I have one for you. I need a reason to not do total body irradiation.,9,22
Then why don't we just do it?,"Because it's premature, reckless, and potentially lethal.",7,7
Then why don't we just don't do it?,Because that would let Cameron in on the fact that I nEver intended to do it.,8,16
"This is gonna be convoluted, isn't it?","I figured I'd ask for something really crazy, so she'd shoot me down and get the whole ""I can control House"" thing out of her perky little system. So the next time I went back and asked for something marginally crazy, it would seem marginally reasonable, and she'd say yes. So, yeah, slightly convoluted.",7,54
"And is there anything we should be doing, you know, to actually help the Patient?","Trust me. In the long term, this'll help all our Patients. In the short term, double the dose of methotrexate and add prednisone.",15,23
"The Patient said she had to go pee. Maybe when she got up, she started to urinate. Increased the vagal tone, caused arrhythmia, and stopped her heart.",Who has to go pee in the middle of a nuclear procedure?,27,12
It wasn't really a nuclear procedure.,She didn't know that. People don't die from peeing.,6,9
Like the classroom with the broken heater and the cold metal table in the procedure room.,"Oh, for God's sake, get a room. Immerse her in an ice bath. The cold will activate her cold agglutinins.",16,20
And giving her another heart attack.,"Lucky for me, there's a flaxen-haired maiden who loves to say yes.",6,12
You hired me to do this job. Let me do it.,"Oh, I'm sorry. Looks like you guys are in the middle of a conversation. I can wait till Cuddy leaves. You are gonna leave soon, aren't you? I mean, the nurses have got your baby out there. Not that they're gonna kidnap it or anything, but I figured that the new mother brings the baby to work because she wants to listen to all the cooing.",11,66
"If you're gonna wait, you can wait outside.","Unless the new mother brings the baby to work because she wants to dump the baby, because she hates the baby and thinks she made a big mistake. You can't trust that Wilson guy with anything.",8,36

For betraying my trust in a vulnerable time? No. Why would that bother me?,"He was worried, made a bad choice. It's not a big deal. I know it seems like crap, you pRobably feel like crap, but it's not. Legally, you haven't adopted her yet. There's no obligations, no strings. It can be undone tomorrow. Emotionally, you'll feel guilty for a while, but the kid! She won't Even know you existed.",14,58
You saying I should give her back?,Much better than having a mother who doesn't give a crap.,7,11

You come to procedures now?,Only the ones that might involve stopping the Patient's heart.,5,10

"All the kids  I try to become a part of them, and then have them become a part of me.",How much longer till the heart attack?,21,7
"She screwed up a room number six years ago, and you decide she has brain damage?",Transposed digits. Classic marker for number confusion. Means she has a lesion in her left parahippocampal region.,16,17
I misdialed a phone number this morning. Must be contagious.,She also forgot to pee before your fake test.,10,9
So she has a small bladder.,Shows an inability to predict the future.,6,7
"Also loCated in the left hemisphere of the brain, close to the parahippocampal region.",Means the damage is ongoing.,14,5
"That's not what this is. Every time a decent person comes in, you set out to prove that they have brain damage.",I nEver said her deranged personality was a symptom.,22,9
You don't need to. I've been here five years. I can hear your thoughts from my apartment.,Can you hear me now?,17,5
The screwed up numbers and forgetting to pee points to her being a huMan being. The platelet dysfunction and cardiac arrest points to a pancreatic tumor.,"Or multiple sclerosis. The brain is like the Internet, packets of information constantly flowing from one area to another. Plaques in her brain are like a bad server, slow down the flow. If it's in the parahippocampus, it'll spread to the brain stem, which means it'll be the lungs next. Brain biopsy will show you the plaques.",26,57
Or we could not cut into her brain. It's just her pancreas. We should do an ERCP.,"Well, we could settle this with rock, paper, scissors, but, unfortunately, there are people who adjudiCate these disputes.",17,18
A pancreatic tumor is much more likely to kill her.,"Not this week, not next week, not next month.",10,9
The number confusions six years ago. You don't think we have time for an ERCP?,"The heart attack was six hours ago. Now, maybe it's planning to go into hiding for a couple years, or maybe it's gonna hit her lungs.",15,26
Stop! We have to assume it's the brain.,I'll go fire up the biopsy drill.,8,7
"No, we had to assume it's the brain until we prove otherwise. Do an MRI, T-2 images.",You want me to do another test?,17,7
"You should be able to see the MS plaques. If they exist, you can do your biopsy.","No. You wanna say yes. You know you should say yes. But you also think that this job is about standing up to me. So you're not gonna say yes. You're not gonna say no. You're just gonna waste time. And the Patient's brain, or pancreas, or whatEver is wrong with her is not gonna wait for you to impress your boss. So pick one, either him or me.",17,69
So can we cancel the biopsy?,Go ahead with the ERCP.,6,5
"Or I respect your opinion, and I want to hear what comes to your mind.",Has she invited any of her lesbian friends into bed with you?,15,12
"It looks promising, reducing symptoms.","No cure then. So, the pros are you might delay the onset of symptoms, give her an extra year, maybe three. She's still dead before you're 45. The question is, are those few years worth risking the rest of your life in medicine?",5,43
"The surgeons were able to drain the pleural effusions. The Patient's breathing on her own, but she's still pretty weak.","Lung failure proves that one of us was right. Who said ""brain""?",20,12
"Yes, you predicted that her lungs would fail, but the MRI was negative for MS.","I was right about the where, but not the what. A picornavirus could cause localized demyelination that the MRI wouldn't pick up. If we run a nerve-conduction study on the surface of her brain we'll see the dead spots.",15,39
Are you talking about cutting into her skull?,"Actually, I'm talking about cutting off her skull, exposing her brain.",8,11
All we need is a more sensitive test. Endoscopic ultrasound.,Just accept that you've been proven wrong.,10,7
You were also proven wrong. Why don't I get a second test?,"Because if I'm right about the brain, then we don't have time to indulge your wrongness.",12,16
Let me know when Cameron says yes to cutting off our Patient's skull. I'll be doing the endoscopic ultrasound.,"Good news. I don't need your approval for some crazy, unproven treatment. I just need to do a test.",19,19
You wanna remove your Patient's skull.,Remind me to revoke Kutner's telephone privileges.,6,7
I didn't realize that was an AMA-approved treatment for MS.,"Not searParkng for MS, but what set it off  equine encephalitis. Turned a cool breeze of MS into a Cat 5 storm.",10,23
Not when it's 30 degrees outside. Transmission is by mosquito.,"So she got bitten six months ago, or it's some other infection. WhatEver it is, it's running rampant in the left side of her brain. When I get in there, I'll get you the specifics.",10,35
"You're asking me to let you cut off the top of someone's head. I need more than, ""I'll know it when I see it.""",So you want proof before you let me go looking for the proof? This is the test.,24,17
You have to give me something.,"Cuddy's gonna love you. The Patient, on the other hand, is gonna hate you until the day she dies next week. Actually, this idiot will pRobably forgive you.",6,28
Don't worry about it. It's just the picture that came with the frame. You can chuck it.,Kid with a raging viral syndrome and three dead mosquitoes. I'm off to storm the Bastille.,17,16
Acute viral nasopharyngitis? One of her students has the common cold?,"Team's not what it used to be. On the other hand, Kutner ran his endoscopic ultrasound, didn't find peep.",11,19
So disproving it's her pancreas proves it's her brain?,"Yes. You used to do this job, remember? That's what used to pass for evidence.",9,15
Now I do this job. You brought me three dead bugs and a runny nose.,"I can't find you the proof you want because it's trapped inside her head. And the only way I can get at it is to cut it open and rip it out, which is apparently the one test you won't let me run. So either I do this, or I do nothing.",15,52
What do you want me to do? Say yes just because you're House?,"I'd certainly like that, yeah.",13,5
Sawing off the top of her skull and placing electrodes on her brain is insane.,"Right, we should be retesting her pancreas for the umpteenth time.",15,11
"You're skipping steps because it's Cameron. You haven't figured her out yet, and you want to see how far you can push.",I'm skipping steps because our Patient is skipping steps on the way to being dead. If you've got a better idea!,22,21
"We should remove her spleen. Splenic lymphoma explains the damaged platelets, the heart, the lungs.","If this doesn't work, the spleen's all yours. Unless I kill her, of course.",15,14
"If this doesn't work, the spleen's all yours. Unless I kill her, of course.","Not only will this allow us to clock your brain's processing speed, you'll also get free cable for the first three months. What's this?",14,24

"I'd nod yes, but I can't move my head.",This pen is red. Its ink is red. Is all ink red?,9,12
Cameron's letting him cut into our Patient's skull based on nothing but dead bugs and someone else's runny nose.,"There are two pints in a quart, four quarts in a gallon. How Many pints in five gallons?",19,18
Insulting me is not gonna make me go away.,You're not here. Obviously I'm not trying to make you go away. Hint  the answer is a number.,9,19
"Oh, that is so annoying. Can you make it stop?",Baby's crying is annoying you? What's her nerve conduction?,10,9
14.3. It's actually speeding up. But her BP's 80 over palp. We're gonna have to stop.,That doesn't make any sense.,16,5
"Please, turn that phone off!","Why does the baby annoy you, but no one else does? I mean, you're right about her, but ",5,19
Can't dose her with anesthesia till the last batch completely clears.,How come the baby annoyed her?,11,6
Her blood pressure's in the tank. I hope she lasts two hours.,What was different? Our Patient loves all things annoying.,12,9
"Her head was open, you were asking her questions, a baby was crying.","She had low blood pressure. According to the laws of physics, low blood pressure causes light-headedness, chest pain, but not annoyance.",13,21
I talked to her. We connected.,You talked at her. You had a chemical reaction.,6,9
Are you trying to annoy me?,I'm trying to explain you.,6,5
Your puke isn't as cute.,"That's 'cause of your hips. If she would've just gestated a little longer, her stomach sphincter would be fully mature. But, no, we have to walk upright, which means that baby's head is too big for mommy's hips. And by the way, your hips may be an evolutionary improvement. So we've evolved to find baby puke cute, 'cause otherwise we'd kill them all before they became functional. Bonding's over. I got to go see another baby.",5,76
You looked at her brain. You took off her skull. You found nothing.,"Didn't look in the right part. Didn't look in the heart part. In the womb, blood has to bypass the lungs, since they don't work yet. When we're born, we take our first big breath, lungs expand, and the ductus closes. Yours didn't.",13,43
She has a patent ductus arteriosis.,"When you get stressed, your blood pressure goes up and forces open the ductus. Blood takes a little detour, makes it leak from your nose, your stomach, your lungs, and, more significantly, keeps it flowing to the right side of your brain and away from your left. Which means that when you get stressed, you get unstressed. That's why you're so good with those annoying kids. And why, when your blood pressure dropped, you were able to identify Cuddy as an annoying huMan being. Good news is we can fix the heart. Bad news for the annoying kids.",6,98
We wanna take this case. She's maybe five or ten years away from curing retinoblastoma.,Which would make this case attractive to anyone who has some vested interest in people curing the incurable.,15,18
Come here. Look at this. Come here.,Adorable. Elevators keep crashing. Is Mercury in retrograde or what?,7,10
Elevators can be capricious. Sometimes it just seems like they're out to get you. She keeps playing with the blanket. Why would she do that?,Why do you think the elevators would be out to get me?,25,12
"I don't know. Maybe they wanted to take time off to spend with their little dumbwaiter.

I'm here because I want to help people.,"No, you're here because it makes you feel good to help people. Taub and Foreman are here because they've got no other viable choices. And Thirteen is desperate to make her life matter before it's over.",8,36
You said that would be stupid.,Does she know? Because Jonas Salk would not approve.,6,9
Your belly's full of blood.,"First her lung deflates, like me after a cold shower. Now her liver starts to bleed, like me after",5,19
Shouldn't you be obsessing over who did this to you?,Nope  anybody bother MRIing our Patient's liver for tumors?,10,10

And your counter-move is to let her have it?,The only time to strike back is when I want something. All I want now is to get things back to normal. Which I can't get by escalating. The only way to win this war is to lose it. Let her punch herself out.,9,44

Every cut of the scalpel could have sent endometrial cells spilling out into her bloodstream. Some of them took up residence in her lungs, some in her liver, some in her spine. And like all horny little cells, they went forth and multiplied till they reached a critical mass. In the days leading up to her next period, when her uterus is supposed to swell, Everything swelled.

"Because when my parents put me in the rocket and sent me here, they said, ""James, you will grow to Manhood under a yellow sun.""",And why'd you lie about monster trucks?,25,7
"I'm playing racquetball tomorrow night, with Taub.",Why would you hide that?,7,5
"Because the world revolves around you. I devote time to anyone else, you'd end up stalking me and harassing them.",You say that as though it wouldn't be fun.,20,9
We know it's not systemic sclerosis.,"Hey, Cyrano de Berkowitz. Let it go.",6,7
The CBC showed normal white blood cells.,So how long have you been playing racquetball with Wilson?,7,10
So he's a late bloomer. His daughter has a neurological condition.,"First of all, Wilson played tennis on his college team, and you are a Jew. You're not athletic. Run to the end of the hall and back. I'll time you.",11,30
Sandy Koufax is Jewish. Greatest left-handed pitcher of all time.,"Sandy Koufax is all you Jews go on about. Sandy Koufax, and the Holocaust. Gets old.",10,16
"There are dozens of congenital conditions that fit our parameters. We can't spend time gene testing for all of 'em, especially when we're only guessing it's congenital.",Is a z-shot offensive or defensive?,27,6
But I could have said neither. Diabetes makes more sense.,We can narrow the testing down to 40 likely candidates. Test for peripheral nerve damage.,10,15
He's got brain damage. He's likely to have peripheral nerve damage no matter what the cause.,"Yes, that's why we should not test him for it. Test the daughter. Kutner runs the nerve test. Taub, you may be right about the diabetes. Take supper away from our Patient and run a glucose tolerance test. Oh, and the nurses have been working so hard. You can do the blood draws yourself.",16,54
They have to be done Every couple hours. You're punishing me because you're jealous that I'm spending time with your best friend.,That would be petty. I'm punishing you because now you've joined my best friend in lying to me. Let me know when you're ready to confess Everything.,22,27
Why'd you page me here?,I need you to update me on the Patient's condition.,5,10
Seems to be dead. Why'd you page me here?,I need you to update me on the Patient's condition while hitting this against the wall. This is the only place we can do both.,9,25
I finished the last blood draw.,I expect the people who work for me to rise to a challenge. Unless they don't expect to work for me.,6,21
Last blood draw was at 6:00 AM. Sugar lEvels nEver rose above 120 all night.,So the glucose was normal. Means you were wrong about diabetes.,15,11
I still think it's the endocrine system. Maybe I just got the wrong gland.,So you're going for thyroid instead of pancreas? Makes sense.,14,10
Fine. I'm not playing racquetball with Wilson. I was nEver playing racquetball with Wilson. I thought it would be helpful if a Department Head owed me a favor. But it's not worth this.,"Not bad. You put on a good show. You studied up. Wilson actually booked a court. If you were really a racquetball player, you'd know that you were holding a squash racket. Tell Kutner to do a thyroid reuptake scan, I'll go grab a nap in one of the on-call rooms.",33,51
"What kind of infection? It could be anything; Staph aureus, tuberculosis, strongyloides!","Go back to Phineas, get a history.",12,7
No one at home is sick. No one at work is sick. There's no sign of ticks or mosquitoes.,Get a more detailed history. Ask him again. And again until he remembers something.,19,14
Get a more detailed history. Ask him again. And again until he remembers something.,Not you. Kutner can do it. You're gonna be busy with something else.,14,13
"Guy leads a boring life. They stay home a lot. No travel, no exotic pets, no nearby standing water.",You sound pleased about something. Can we get to that part?,19,11
"His wife rescues dogs. Among others, a big rottweiler who's taken over the House. Our Patient hates it.",Was the wife there to hear this?,18,7
The dog marks his territory all over the living room. I asked what the odds were that he would have put down food or drink where the dog could reach. He said he put a glass of juice on the floor while he was fixing the television.,The dog was fixing the television?,47,6
I told Wilson you sent me to get information.,"And now you're telling me. What does that make you, a quadruple agent?",9,13
He let me print out his e-mails.,Wow. Excellent. Information he wants us to have. Did he let you print out his deleted e-mails?,7,17
"As long as I was sitting there, I thought I'd print 'em anyway. Top one's the one you're looking for.",Writing to confirm Wednesday at 7:00 PM.,20,7
It's out going to jgonzaleznymercy.net. There's a Joan Gonzalez in oncology. It's a consult.,"Secret consult, 7:00 PM. Oh, Joan is perky.",14,8
"I don't want to ask this, but, have you Ever had reason to think he might be depressed?",No. Get out of here.,18,5
Get the hell out of my room.,"Your assistant said that you were out of the hospital, taking a walk.",7,13
Maybe you just don't have a good statistical sampling of my walks.,"The other thing you do when you need to think is you come to my office. Apparently, this is something you can only discuss with Gonzalez at New York Mercy.",12,30
"Look, I'd love to stay for the full inquisition, but I need some hot coffee.","Of course you need hot coffee. It's 45 degrees outside, and you left your coat upstairs. Why?",15,17
You're going to tell me why I forgot my coat?,"Once you get outside, the cold would have reminded you. You could have come back, but you didn't. You chose to be uncomfortable. Now, why would someone choose that? Because they hate themselves?",10,33
Nick Greenwald. I hear you're the guy in charge. I'm the Patient with the disinhibition.,"If you're here to say thanks, you're welcome. Now go away.",15,11
"Oh, I'm not thankful. I'm pissed.","Oh, all the more reason to go away.",6,8
"So I'm either better or dead? I'm okay with that. I  I've always been kind of a! an imPatient guy. But I've worked hard to keep my mouth shut. I've made my wife happy. I've made my little girl happy. I want that back. Otherwise, it's no life.",I want you to remove a small pRoblem.,49,8
It's too near the brain stem. Nobody's gonna touch it.,"Your boss would. He's an egoManiac. I know 'cause I keep seeing him at the club. He just needs a little push. I'm sure by now you've kissed his ass sufficiently. Would you like me to phrase it as ""you're politically gifted""? I can do that.",10,46
Why you care. The puzzle's solved. The guy's alive. And the odds of coming out of this surgery with that same status aren't that great.,My Patient has a quality of life issue.,25,8
"He says awful things, hardly a medical condition.","When he leaves here, he's going to lose his family. He's gonna alienate the people he works with. And if he Ever finds a friend who's willing to put up with his crap, he'll be lucky. Until he drives them away too.",8,42
I'll see what I can do.,You've apparently got this whole coat thing backwards.,6,8
I knew you'd meet me halfway.,"It made me think. You only snap on one subject: losing people. So I went back to the intel. It's true there's only one doctor named Gonzalez at New York Mercy, but there's a Javier Gonzalez who's a nurse in the psych ward. And who could you lose who'd end up there?",6,52
Maybe the reason I don't always open up to you is because it's redundant.,"Daniel Wilson. Once you got a name, it's amazing how much stuff you can learn on the phone. I mean, if you're a doctor and you lie freely. They found your brother sleeping in the lobby of an office building in Manhattan. Got aggressive when they asked him to leave, and the cops took him to the Mercy psych ward.",14,60
"There have been new anti-psychotics dEveloped since he ran away. He's been on them for a couple of days, and by tonight, he should be in shape to talk to me.",But you're not sure if he wants to.,31,8
"I'll be in New York in a few hours, and I guess I'll find out.",Why wouldn't you tell me this?,15,6
"House, you and I! We don't have the normal social contract. I don't expect you to tell me the lies ",I am fully capable of lying to you. I've lied plenty of times.,21,13
"I mean, collaborative lies. Giving someone a hand who maybe needs to deceive themselves, just a little. For two days I've been thinking about how Danny's gonna react when he sees me. If I said that to anybody else, they'd say, ""don't worry, it'll all be all right."" You wouldn't.",Because it might all go horribly wrong.,50,7
Feel free to send him an IM.,You told me you saw your brother once. After he disappeared.,7,11
"13 years ago. I used to go to Princeton whenEver I could. I must have hit Every homeless shelter in town. And then one day, I'm just sitting at this deli, having a sandwich, I look out the window, and there he is. He was gone by the time I got outside.",That's why you were so eager when I told you there was a job at Princeton. I thought it was just my charm.,52,23
That's the team. Shouldn't you answer?,They already texted me to say they're doing something stupid.,6,10
"Med school. He, called me, Every day. Talked for hours. I didn't have hours.",Interesting. Later for that. Go on.,14,6
"I was tired of being the guy that Everybody counted on, so one night, Danny called  One night, Danny called, crying, upset about something. I had to study for an exam. So I  I hung up! Took my things. I went to the library so I wouldn't have to hear the phone ring.",I wonder how that turned out?,55,6
"My mother called me the next day. Danny had run away and left his meds behind. Which I knew meant that he would nEver be able to choose to come back, because he'd be so detached from reality.","So you made your one effort to live a normal, selfish life, and the universe immediately smacked you down. And because we're wired to find meaning in semi-random Events, you decided nEver to be that careless again.",38,37
You don't think that's a little facile?,"Actually, I don't. I think you did it consciously. You dEveloped your people-pleasing talents the way an Olympic athlete dEvelops his muscles. Talk about an overreaction to a single Event.",7,30
It was a pretty big Event.,"Hanging up the phone? That's what you're blaming all this on. That's the behavior you've been trying to correct. As though nothing else went wrong in your brother's life. Of course, he overreacted too but! His glucose was normal?",6,39
"We're not talking about my brother anymore, are we?",It's House. AVMs don't explain his glucose.,9,7
It doesn't explain the organ failure or the brain damage.,"This whole thing is an overreaction. That one small fibroma. It's benign, but his body's acting like it's an invader. His antibodies went to war against it and got carried away, attacked his other systems. Take out the fibroma, he'll be a happy hypocrite again in no time.",10,48
I'll be seeing Danny again next week. I'd like you to meet him.,Sure. He sounds interesting. Go on.,13,6
"I thought seeing him again would change Everything. It would be wonderful or terrible. Instead! we're just strangers. It's kind of, anticlimactic.",Which is better than terrible.,22,5
"No, see, this  if you were implementing the social contract, you'd say that, but only because! It makes me feel better!",It is kind of fun watParkng you torture yourself.,22,9
Do you think things will work out with my brother?,"No. But when it does go wrong, it won't be your fault.",10,12
"You have a Patient waiting, see?",I'm waiting for a follow-up.,6,5
I had colds all winter.,"I've been in this room a while, but it's spring now, right?",5,12
I feel run-down like maybe something big is coming on.,"Run-down. Come on, give me something. Sore throat?",10,8
"No. I know it sounds weird, I'm a nurse, but could you run maybe a CBC or thyroid up ","Dr. Cuddy, I need a consult. Until she stops seizing, I may as well go back to my office and get my diagnosis on.",20,24
"""Neuro"" is also written in green. Does that mean she has green neurological symptoms as well?",From now on I'm gonna use two colors. Green indiCates irony.,16,11
Why are we taking this case?,"Welcome, your lordship. We were just preparing your morning briefing.",6,10
"Sorry I'm late. And, yes, green pee does meet the only diagnostic requirement you care about! it's interesting. But is it worth us taking this case?","""Us"" aren't taking anything. I'm taking. You're accepting.",26,8
"Okay, I accept. She has adult-onset epilepsy, and she really likes those Saint Patrick's Day beers.",Go check out the House and the office for toxins and infections.,16,12
"You got conned. Methylthioninium chloride. Notable side effect, green urine. She's a nurse. She knows the dosage. Knows how to fake a seizure. She pees pea soup and gets the warm attention of doctors all week long. She's a Munchausen and you're her mark.",So your insight is based on discovering an anti-Alzheimer's drug at an old-age home.,44,14
No good reason it'd be sitting in her desk.,You Ever tried to pee on yourself in public? It's not easy.,9,12
"Sorry, I rushed the Jewish frat. We peed in private.",For good reason. I can spot a fake seizure. Which means this was real. Which means her pRoblem is phenol.,10,20
"Carbolic acid? Yeah, maybe she accidentally inhaled some at a gout treatment facility circa 1890.",It's still in some antiseptic throat sprays. She's been chugging it all winter for her colds. Phenol explains the seizure and the urine.,15,23
She'd have to drink five bottles a day.,Which is why I'm sure you won't have trouble discovering evidence of it when you search her House. Bye. And you can start her on charcoal hemoperfusion for the phenol poisoning. Seriously?,8,32
"Oh, you were lying about the throat spray. That does make more sense. So why are you wasting Taub's time?",Because I don't want him to know that I'm wasting my time disproving his fake seizure theory. Zip.,20,18
What about a thyroid uptake or abdominal ultrasound?,Sure. How about I flash some lights in front of your face first?,8,13
You want me to have another seizure?,We're gonna have to give up the room unless we can confirm a pRoblem.,7,14
"Please forgive me, I'm so sorry.",What are you worried about? You have maybe a night in jail for fraud. I have to go tell one of my employees he was right.,6,26
I'm not a Munchausen. I'm gonna die unless you help me.,You'll have to come up with something more original.,11,9
A cat predicted my death.,"Cats make terrible doctors. Oh no, wait, that's women. You're screwed.",5,11
"A few years back, I was one of them. Good luck, Neil.","If you're going to kill me and rape me, please do it in that order.",12,15
"This is the cat, Debbie. Have you heard of her?","Debbie. Sorry, but without a last name!",10,7
"She was in the news. We found her as a kitten. She lives in the nursing home. She only sleeps next to people when they're about to die. Ten Patients in the last year. And then yesterday she did it to me while I was sitting on my couch. Please, the whole staff, the doctors Even, we all know this is real.",Can you come back later? I have some business I'm conducting with the Prince of Nigeria.,62,16
"Just watch this video. It'll prove I'm not lying. Dr. House, I am begging you. Chest.",Quick! Before she goes without attention for eight seconds.,16,9
"Debbie the cat spends most of her time just prowling the halls, the queen of her own private world.","Gotta say, I don't think the changes they've made to American Idol really work for me.",19,16
You want to treat her? She's a nut job.,Don't we all have quirks? Aren't those eccentricities what make us huMan?,9,12
The doctors we spoke to also agree!,Nut jobs get sick too.,7,5
So you think this cat story is nonsense. And you admit she faked her earlier symptoms. But you still think she's actually sick now?,"Well, anything would sound ridiculous if you said it in that voice.",24,12
"No cough, no fEver, and Blofeld didn't smoke a cigar.","He might have. Dude had a lair. Means he was rich. Rich people enjoy a good stogie, sometimes send them as gifts. Hey, Taub! Did that sound like I was awkwardly trying to segue into making a point?",10,38
"Lungs were clean on the CT. Dogs can be trained to predict diabetic comas, epileptic seizures; they can smell cancer. It is possible there's something in this cat.",It's more possible that it was just a coincidence. 10 million nursing homes.,28,13
Maybe the cat didn't predict anything. Might have caused the deaths.,We shoulda listened to Ted Nugent.,11,6
"Yeah, it could be cat scratch fEver or visceral larva migrans. Maybe he didn't kill Everyone at the nursing home, but it may be killing Morgan.",The worms hop from the cat to the cat lady's lungs. I could buy that.,26,15
Those cigars were for me.,"Hey, that reminds me, why is some fancy CEO sending you a box of Cuban cigars? Is it related to your money worries?",5,23
There are no worms in the lungs.,What else could cause bronchospasm?,7,5
Why are you pushing a crash cart?,"Because Patients sometimes crash, and they haven't yet invented a crash tractor for me to drive wildly around the hallways.",7,20
You actually think the cat is going to predict someone's death?,"No, I know the cat is not going to predict anyone's death. Then I will have scientifically disproved!",11,18
"You didn't keep this Patient despite the cat, you kept this Patient because of the cat. You're scared there's something to it.","If I could prove the non-existence of an omniscient God who lovingly guides us to the other side, I would. Cat version will have to do. Are you scared?",22,29
"Cats' brains are always in alpha mode. The few scientific tests that have seemed to confirm psyParkc phenomena, that's where it takes place.",Please tell me that you were kidding so I won't have to fire you.,23,14
Don't you want to check their charts?,Of course not. This is a double-blind. I don't want to Even subconsciously,7,13
"I told you to get rid of ""death cat.""",Do you see a cat?,9,5
I see a litter box.,"This is a disability, Dr. Cuddy. Can't make it to the men's room on time.",5,15
You pee on the mice too?,"Well, now you see the mice actually prove that I don't have a cat.",6,14
Get rid of the cat and get rid of your Patient.,My team's doing a methacholine challenge.,11,6
"Your team just completed a methacholine challenge, which came up negative.",Who told you about the test? Taub?,11,7
I'll nEver say. But yes.,"Her airways clamped down. I heard it. We kick her onto the street, it could happen again. I wish there was a lawsuit cat. It could warn you.",5,28
"I'm sorry, but if you won't escort her out, I'll have to get security to do it.",You're joining me for a good-bye smoke.,17,7
I was married. I got divorced.,"Two years before that, you got Parkcken pox shots, which you only get in adulthood when you have a kid. Or I should say when you had a kid because no kid has come to visit you. Which all makes me think something bad happened.",6,45
He was in school. He was having his morning snack. And he choked. And the teacher saw it and they did Everything that they were supposed to. He shouldn't have died.,You want to make it make sense.,31,7
"Hey, doc. Breath sound soft to you, doc? Hooray! You're officially sick.","Churg-Strauss fits best. Here's the plan! Taub, change the litter box.",12,11
This is pathetic. You're still punishing me for calling you out on the green urine lady?,"Nope, this is for ratting me out to Cuddy. I'm not asking you to apologize, just scoop some poop out of a box.",16,23
"Now that you've delivered that important lesson, I'm gonna go test the Patient.","What, you think your bag's gonna die now?",13,8
Now you're punishing me because you think I'm superstitious? What do you care?,"It's not so much about me caring per se. It's more about me wondering why you're such a credulous idiot. Thirteen, start the Patient on steroids for the Churg-Strauss. Unless we have something we need to argue about.",13,38
"It's brown. I didn't do anything, honest.",I'm just a girl who can't say no.,7,8
It is possible she's still faking.,"She didn't fake the bronchospasm. You think she's faking some stuff but not other stuff? Maybe she's ""Unchausen"".",6,18
We've ruled out Every possible cause for brown urine. No blood in the urine. Liver and kidneys fine.,Brown could be fecal. A fistula!,18,6
How do we know the urine is still brown?,Had to be. Once you've gone brown!,9,7
"If we've ruled out Everything that can make the urine brown, what if it just looked brown? If the green dye nEver left her system, what plus green makes brown?",Purple. Strep bovis infection from colon cancer. Paraneoplastic syndrome would explain the bronchospasm.,30,13
I wasn't scared by the umbrella either.,"What? Not Everything's about you, Kutner.",7,6
I realize it's stupid. I just! I don't know Everything. I don't want to invite!,"Great, 'cause I thought your superstitiousness had to do with your folks being killed. But ""you're stupid"" works just as well.",15,21
Why is there a ladder here?,"Oops. Forgot that one. Scopes don't work as well as pillcams. Give her one. Find the tumor. Come with me, tiny Taub.",6,22
Sorry I was late again. I've got a long commute from the poor House.,"Knew it when I hired you. You'd Eventually miss the money, being the big shot like your new CEO friend, if that night club stamp on your hand is any indication.",14,31
"Don't worry, I'm not quitting.",I know. Guy who signs a non-compete instead of just telling his wife that he cheated doesn't have the guts to quit.,5,22
Bad example. I did tell her.,"From guilt, not from courage. And bravely running to Cuddy behind my back. Arriving heroically late Every day. Cowards make lousy employees. Maybe you're a coward, maybe you're quitting. Either way, I'm screwed.",6,33
"From guilt, not from courage. And bravely running to Cuddy behind my back. Arriving heroically late Every day. Cowards make lousy employees. Maybe you're a coward, maybe you're quitting. Either way, I'm screwed.","You will note how ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" has snuggled up by Coma Guy over there. And more importantly, she did yesterday as well. And he's still breathing.

Thank you for showing me this. But maybe she's just confused in this new environment.,"In 1844 a preacher in upstate New York added up some dates in the bible and predicted Jesus' return. His followers gave away all their possessions and showed up in a field. Guess who didn't show. So the preacher said that he miscalculated, and they went right back the next month but with more followers. Every time he was irrefutably proved wrong, it redoubled Everyone's belief.",15,66
You're trying to prove to her she's not dying?,That would be dumb as she might be dying.,9,9
This Woman lost her kid. Why are you attacking beliefs that give her a little bit of comfort?,I don't care if her superstitions make her feel better. I just want her to think more clearly.,18,18
Oh. Maybe that could make her as happy as you are. Where are we going?,"Experimenting. Stop it, Dr. Wilson. It's just not cute anymore!",15,10
You already experimented on the coma guy. Haven't you proved your point?,Not to the Patient. And not to the millions of idiots who drooled over that news item about the magic cat.,12,21
Why are you so obsessed with this? Can't you just call her an idiot and leave Everyone alone?,"Hey, look, kids, therapy cat.",18,5
"You're a liar. Therapy animals are dogs, not cats.",Aren't you feisty? This one's special. If she likes you interesting stuff happens.,9,13
"No, okay. Uh, kids, playtime's over. You know what, this is a good thing. Because either you're starting to doubt yourself, which is healthy, or ",I don't beliEve in the legend of goodbye kitty.,26,9
"Or, you're starting to give a crap what other people think. Which is just another way of saying you give a crap about other people.","I'd love to hear more of your theory, but I don't give a crap. Also, the pillcam's back.",25,18
How Many times are we gonna watch this? There's no tumor.,"Oh my God, the death cat is attacking your legs. You're going to die.",11,14
Maybe it has something to do with that little red dot dancing around down there.,"Oh my God, the death laser is attacking your legs. You're going to die.",15,14
Maybe we're not wasting time. We wouldn't have seen a flat lesion.,Skin cancer could have metastasized to the intestines. Cool. Check for melanomas.,12,12
It's not cancer. We found spider veins on her back. They weren't there when she came in.,"Spider veins means Cushing's. Could cause an abdominal disturbance, brown urine!",17,11

Cat's nose is powerful. It could smell liver or kidney failure.,"Exactly, except if you'd glanced at the nursing home files I had faxed over this morning, you'd know that most of the Patients' livers and kidneys were fine; what else?",11,30
ACTH is 11.7. It's too close to tell. We can't treat the wrong organ 'cause that won't solve anything. She could have a cortisol storm. Could kill her.,"Well, maybe as the senior fellow you could have made sure that my doors were closed, so that I could be concentrating on the cat instead of looking for the cat.",28,31
"Sounds like he said ""do you like cranberry juice?"" Crap.",Cheaper than fake blood. And more cran-tastic. Don't Ever leave my door open like that again.,10,16
You're playing pranks and this Woman could be dying.,"So have Chase do a venous sampling in her brain. If he finds something, it's there. If he finds nothing, it's the adrenals.",9,23
What exactly are you hoping to find inside your dead coma guy?,Catnip. Chew toy. I don't know. That's why I'm looking!,12,10
Are you sure that it's Cushing's? You'd expect central body obesity. She's in good shape.,"If it had a normal presentation, there wouldn't be a cat involved.",15,12
So it's the brain. That means the next question is whether to remove the pituitary right now!,That's not a question for me. That's a question for the Patient. You'll present both sides and let her decide.,17,20
I've got to stop telling you my theories. You always just try to prove me wrong.,You mean the theory about Cuddy's ass getting bigger at the full moon? I confirmed that one. Photo's on my blog.,16,21
"Normally, you'd be up in the Patient room hectoring her on what to do. Instead you're up to your elbows in some irrelevant dead guy who may or may not be connected to a magic cat because you want to prove to me that you don't care.",Case is over. I'm exploring a scientific mystery.,47,8

"Really? Well, that's interesting, but! you're here because you crashed your motorcycle, not because I need a consult. So, get back in bed.","Scraped my elbow. I just need a truckload of Vicodin. Whereas, this guy!",23,13
"No, no, no, it's not! It's me.",Then why is his eye following you?,7,7
"No, no, I'm not dead. I need help. I'm here!",I also know about locked-in syndrome! That things are either involuntary! or voluntary. Blink if you can hear me.,10,19
"No, I can't be stuck like this.",Unless! the crash didn't cause the brain damage. Maybe the brain damage caused the crash.,7,15
Yeah. I couldn't stop. Why couldn't I stop?,Look at his palms. No scrapes. He didn't Even try to protect himself. Suggests slowed reflexes! or no reflexes.,8,19
"Yeah, and you're the guy who wants to cut out my organs, and he's the guy who doesn't.","Get me the scans. Stroke, cancer, Even a simple infection. Anything that insults the central pons could do this.",18,19
It was a melted PowerBar.,"She's the smart one. I just keep dark and darker to fill out the quota. If we find it, treat it, you could be fine.",5,25
"I nEver thought I'd be praying for a brain tumor, but please, dear God.","If you're praying in there, stop it right now.",14,9
We'll get his doctor to order an MRI.,"His doctor's busy teaParkng him how to blink out ""kill me"" in Morse code. Luckily, I found some forms under the mattress.",8,22
I hope they! work! wow. You're in my relaxing scenario?,I guess you like me.,10,5
I'm not sure if I beliEve in God.,You spend an awful lot of time in church for someone who doesn't.,8,13
I don't not beliEve either.,It's either one or the other.,5,6
"I go to church mainly to keep my wife happy, but! I don't know, I've nEver actually thought that God could reach out and affect my life. But getting a brilliant doctor in the bed next to me?",God is also the guy who opened his car door in front of you.,38,14
"I get it. You're a little nuts, aren't you?","Your wife is the one getting you through this. Your wife and me. Although frankly, the MRI was a lot more useful than four hours of hand-holding. I think.",9,29
"If he had a wife, he'd know why it matters.",You're a good guy. Easy to talk to.,10,8
"Wait, something's happening. What's happening to me?",Need some help in here! Your Patient is seizing.,7,9
Why are you still arguing with this guy? You thought I was dead.,Welcome back. And nicely played. You almost died. Exactly as we planned.,13,12
You knew this was going to happen?,"It usually happens when you treat cancer by pretending it's not cancer. Right, doctor? My turn?",7,16
I got the transfer papers. Plasmapheresis is all set up. Are you okay?,Fresh infusion of macho. You like?,13,6
"What were you doing up there, anyway?","Antiquing. I found you a late Victorian corset. Come by later, I'll tie you up.",7,15
Sorry I didn't show up in Middletown. I didn't get the message.,PRobably because there was no message. I've decided to accept your resignation.,12,12
"Uh, I thought we were past this. I decided to stay.","No, you didn't. You had it decided for you. So now you're stuck here with a boss who knows that you want to be somewhere else. Which means you're no longer motivated to impress me, which means you're no longer motivated to come up with good ideas. Unless I'm wrong. Save the cheerleader. Save your world. I got it from here.",11,61
"Yeah, I heard that. It used to belong to a guitarist who died in a motorcycle accident. It just reeks of you screwing with people. Your crash was ten miles from the Orange County Progressive Pain Clinic.","You live ten miles from Mary's Dress Shop. And yet, that's not Even on my list of reasons that I think you're secretly a transvestite.",37,25
We're going to biopsy the brain stem?,"For the record, that doesn't count as your inspired idea. It's sort of where I was heading.",7,17
How come I'm not better? God's not supposed to work in trial and error.,"God's mistakes are well-documented. If he'd done Everything right the first time, there'd have been one plague and zero great floods.",14,21
Those were because of huMan mistakes.,You think your doctor has an apartment on Mount Olympus?,6,10
Why aren't his eyes moving?,"Two options: My neurologist screwed up, or else something the hospital Lawyer's going to have to come up with when you sue us.",5,23
"But he's still in there, right? I mean, he just can't communiCate?","It's possible. Also possible is that the surgery caused so much swelling in his brain stem, that he's just gone.",12,20
"It's possible. Also possible is that the surgery caused so much swelling in his brain stem, that he's just gone.",He had one way to communiCate and now that's gone. Well played.,20,12
"He runs a business, meets a lot of people he could've picked up rotavirus.",Did he report having bloody diarrhea?,14,6
"We've prioritized. He can only blink, a real history would've taken weeks.","If he had Epstein-Barr, he'd have belly pains. If he had picornavirus, he'd have headaches. Five other yesno questions, and maybe we'd know what treatment to give. And what treatment would kill him. Unless he's already dead.",12,37
I called the ex-ex-ex-wife. She was at a sweat lodge in New Mexico last week. What were you really doing in New York?,You know how you hate it when I meddle in your lies? I mean your life.,23,16
Why are you being so evasive? Unless you have something to evade.,"Interesting. This has nothing to do with you, your ex-wife, or my pain. I was heading to the Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill.",12,23
One of your hookers arrange a conjugal visit?,It's where Foreman's brother is being held.,8,7
"I am scared. Molly, I love you so much.",Have you had any bloody diarrhea in the last two weeks?,9,11
He was in St. Louis.,Good. Could be Missouri malaria. Let's start treatment.,5,8
He was! he was there. The maParkne must not be working.,"Hmmm. Either that or he lied to you about it. People do that sometimes. For example, I just lied to him about Missouri malaria.",11,24
I should've told you. Why didn't I just tell you? Down.,"When you weren't in St. Louis for two days, I assume you were getting some strange for two days.",11,19
So does she. You have to tell her I wasn't.,Amazing. A Man who only has two blips at his disposal can still lie.,10,14
I'm liking this one more and more. Don't fire him.,Were you out of the state?,10,6
I want to keep my job.,Great. All you gotta do is come up with a good idea.,6,12
"How about we hook the guy's brain to a computer, so he can communiCate?",That's a great idea. For the guy who invented the computer that can read minds. Your idea was to use his idea.,14,22
"You didn't come up with it. No one else came up with it. If I didn't re-establish communication, we nEver would have found ",What's interesting is why you're here now. Not when I gave you the ultimatum. Was it something the Patient said?,24,20
I realized that what we do here! terrifies me. And! overcoming that is the only way I can matter.,Kutner found the battery factory. Kutner came up with the cadmium. Maybe you don't matter.,19,15
"When's the last time you changed that dressing? Judging by the smell of it, I'd say nEver.","He's locked-in, his kidneys blew a fuse, and now his eye is oozing pus.",17,14
"I assume you went over all of that with your team. I also assume they didn't have any brilliant ideas, or you wouldn't still be muttering to yourself. This is going to hurt.",Ow! The way he's losing his myelin makes an infection most likely. Could be varicella ,33,16
Road Debris has come to the surface. I'm going to have to scrub it out.,But the initial acyclovir would've treated that. Which pushes me towards an autoimmune disease. Like Behcet's.,15,16
"Here! this is going to hurt Even more. Take two now, two later.","Oops. Ho! Of course, if the varicella was resistant, it wouldn't matter what they did up in Middletown.",13,18
"Or you could use the LP for something useful. If you find polys, it's varicella. Lymphs, Behcet's.",Why did I fire you again?,17,6
"You weren't visiting Foreman's brother, either.","Busy. Kutner's doing an LP, so I have to focus.",6,10
"I had prison security check visitor logs, phone records. You've nEver had any contact with anyone at Fishkill. So, I ask again! What were you doing up in Middletown?",You know what's more interesting than what I was doing? The reason you are so obsessed with what I was doing.,29,21
How! how did you know?,Your only secrets are the girls you find embarrassing. And the only embarrassing girl you've met recently is the one at your brother's cuckoo facility.,5,25
We've only been out a few times.,She's a caregiver. Like all of your other failed exes. And someone who takes care of your brother. Who was the last person who took care of your brother?,7,29
You think this is Oedipal?,"Actually, I was thinking masturbatory, but I guess your mom took care of him first. So, the safe course is to gouge your eyes out.",5,25
There is no God. You don't know what's wrong with me.,It doesn't seem that way.,11,5
"No. No. Let me go. He can't fix me. I've been here for three days, Everything hurts.","The arrest means the demyelination hit the area in his brainstem that controls heart rhythm. We need answers fast, 'cause this is going to happen again.",17,26
"So we put in a temporary pacer, it's not gonna ","Shut up, shut up. He's trying to talk. Is something bothering you?",11,12
"Maybe he's not saying ""no,"" maybe he's saying ""down."" Are you saying that the pain is lower? How low, your leg? Your foot?","Left foot? Check his! let me see now! yeah, his right foot.",23,12
"No bruises, no rashes, no cuts.",Then there should be no pain. Is it a tingling sensation? Is it itParkng?,6,14
Then there should be no pain. Is it a tingling sensation? Is it itParkng?,Itchy foot means liver failure.,14,5
The liver's fine. His enzymes have been normal since we admitted him.,"I didn't say ""failing,"" I said ""failure."" Just like you. Liver's like a cruise ship taking on water. As it starts to sink, it sends out an S.O.S. Only instead of radio waves, it uses enzymes. The more enzymes in the blood, the worse the liver is. And once the ship has sunk, there's no more S.O.S. You think the liver's fine, but it's already at the bottom of the sea.",12,71
"So dying liver released toxins, damaged the nerves, led to locked-in syndrome.",Now we just need to know what's causing the liver failure.,12,11
"Liver, plus eye, plus kidney! most likely sclerosing cholangitis.","Oh, God, if only Taub had said that, it would've been a happy ending. Do a biopsy to confirm.",9,19
It was his idea. He saw the rash ,"If he did, he'd have hung a ""mission accomplished"" banner in my outer office.",9,14
Don't toy with him. If you're going to fire him ,The fact that he stole your idea means that he cares enough to lie. That's all I needed to know. Rat pee. That's a very nice idea.,11,27
House. You left this in my office.,"No, I didn't. So either I have a hole in my pocket ",7,13
"Oh, that's right I remember now, I stole it. Because if you had gone up there to check out my girlfriend, you wouldn't have come back here and lied to me about it. You would've thrown her right in my face.",You underestimate the entertainment value of your obsessions.,41,8
And then there were all those calls you weren't taking in front of me. So I dialed the number of the calls you weren't taking. You're seeing a psyParkatrist.,You had no right to invade my privacy.,29,8
You're spying on your team.,"Prioritize, Wilson. Is that what you really want to torture me about right now?",5,14
I don't want to torture you at all. I think this is a great thing. Not something you have to drive an hour out of town to shroud in mystery.,Yeah. Whining on someone's couch. That's an excellent use of my time. Maybe I'll discover that my Parkldhood wasn't perfect.,30,20
So your attitude about therapy clearly hasn't changed. And yet you went. Which leads me to beliEve that maybe something else has changed. Maybe you think you can change. Credit Cuddy with that.,"Not much credit to take, because I'm not going back.",33,10
Do not let the fact that I found out about it ,Don't beat yourself up. I'm not going back because it doesn't work.,12,12
"54-year-old Woman with acute respiratory failure. No anaphylaxis, lung issues or tracheal lesions. Tox screen was clean for coke and amphetamines.","I will give you 30 reasons, one for each pound that cause the apnea which enflamed the epiglottis. Why is our rainbow coalition missing brown and bi?",21,27
No apnea because no sleeping pRoblems when she's sleeping. She spent the last six months caring for her husband who's dying of heart failure.,"Reason 31  whatEver whacked the husband's heart is also whacking her airway and! Oh, good. I thought maybe Kutner was home nursing the rib you broke when you elbowed your way in for credit on the last Patient.",24,39
I contributed. And the Patient's illness wasn't caused by her husband unless lung cancer's contagious.,Interesting. Not about the Patient. That was kinda dull. I thought maybe you were lying to cover for Kutner which sounds noble. Except you're doing it out of guilt instead of love.,15,32
Could have picked up melioidosis from one of the islands.,Would have jumped to the husband and finished off him and his lame immune system.,10,15
"No tumors, no drugs, no bacteria. Leaves viral  varicella zoster.",Start her on IV fluids and acyclovir.,11,7
Can't. She's deManding to be released so she can get home to her husband.,"How sweet. They can die together instead of separately, 40 years apart.",14,12
The mind can heal the body. Seeing his wife in distress might have actually slowed down his death.,Or he could have just had an adrenaline surge when he saw his chance to hit the singles market. Send her home.,18,22
The pageant starts in an hour. You have to do something. There's something wrong inside her head. It's like she has no idea what's going on around her.,"I thought she was just flirting with me. I can fix it, but it's gonna cost you! 3.75. I'm not just gonna give you my coffee. Think of it as Costa Rican sober juice.",28,34
She can resume her vigil over her husband who started fading again.,"Win some, lose some. And strictly speaking, since he's not my Patient, win some. Look at the time. It's half past ""Taub was lying about Kutner.""",12,26
"He pRobably went to a comic book fest, spent the night at some Wonder Woman's lair. I'm sure he'll ","Find out what or who he's doing. Either way, Cuddy's gonna want me to write it under ""reason for termination.""",20,20
Not to someone who actually cares.,He didn't slit his wrists and! peacefully drift away. He shot himself. He didn't leave a note. That means panic. Which could have been preempted if the idiots who worked alongside him for 80 hours a week had seen this coming.,6,41
This isn't our fault! Something like 25 of suicidal people show no outward signs of depression.,No. 25 of suicidal people have friends who didn't notice anything and don't want to feel guilty.,16,17
"We still have a Patient. Actually, two. One worsening, one who should be worsening.",You can't be in denial about Kutner and the husband.,14,10
It's possible Eddie's body is willing itself to live.,"Well, call the tabloids. Tell them you just witnessed the miracle of slightly increased kidney function.",9,16
Maybe we should pass this file over to another doctor.,And the next one too? The one after that? How Many files till it's okay that Kutner's dead? Cardiac enzymes means she didn't have a heart attack. No vision pRoblems means no mitochondrial disease.,10,34
"I'm sorry. I've hired a grief counselor whom I'm sure none of you will see and I'm offering time off, which I'm sure none of you will take. But just know it's available.",Polyserositis fits. Start her on indomethacin.,33,6
If you'd rather not deal with this case!,I'm fine. Despite what Wilson will say.,8,7
He hasn't come to you?,Pretty sure he has mah-jongg Tuesday mornings. I assume he thinks I will work through this better if I don't have to keep flicking his wings off my shoulder.,5,29
You didn't Even have an inkling?,I know his fantasy football team cratered. Figured he'd gotten over it.,6,12
Well! Sorry for your loss.,Thanks. But it's not my loss.,5,6
Then I'm sorry you don't think it is.,Patient's membranes aren't gonna heal themselves.,8,6
Wish we did. We all ,"It was his name. He was conflicted, didn't know where he fit in, being ripped out of his world and stuck into yours.",6,23
We encouraged him to hold onto his heritage.,It's hard to still be Lawrence Choudhary when Everyone sees you as Kutner.,8,13
It was his idea to take our name.,Then you should have said no.,8,6
"We loved that boy, you son of a bitch.","You wanted to make him happy by shutting out his pain. When he looked happy, you assumed the pain had gone. It just got buried deeper, leaving him tormented about who he was until finally he put a bullet ",9,40
House! Go back to the hospital.,I'm sorry about your son.,6,5
"Indomethacin had no effect. She's still in pain. Rules out polyserositis. I ran a hormone panel on Eddie. His prolactin's above normal. Means he's actually improving. Body chemistry changes for all sorts of reasons  stress, fear! Why not love? But maybe he's going into some sort of remission",You haven't asked if I learned anything relevant from the Kutners.,49,11
"If you had, I'm sure you would have mentioned it.",Or you're afraid there is something relevant. Which would mean you could have saved him.,10,15
I don't buy that suicide is always a cry for help. Sometimes you just don't want help.,Good thing you got some. Or you'd have tried again and gotten it right.,17,14
She doesn't have Wegener's. Kidney function's normal. It's not byssinosis. It's not mitral valve stenosis. Nothing fits.,"If it doesn't fit any diagnosis, it just leaves one diagnosis.",17,11
"If it doesn't fit any diagnosis, it just leaves one diagnosis.",I'm Dr. House. You have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. His heart is too weak. Yours is too strong. Good news is it's fixable. We induce a massive heart attack and kill off the extra muscle.,11,33
You wanna give me a heart attack?,It's only dangerous if your heart is normal size. But since all the ,7,14
How could she be! The windpipe thing?,"That was real. Treatment made her better. But good for her was bad for you which was bad for her. So she made herself bad. It's all so simple. She figured the sicker she was, the longer you'd hang on.",7,40
We haven't been this close for years. I wanted to hang on to that. Ow!,"Oh, please. People hate reruns.",15,5
It's my leg. I swear this is real!,"What, you pinky swear or you just plain swear? Because ",8,11
Mr. and Mrs. Kutner. They caused Kutner's death. Why not Charlotte's?,"Mourning period's over. Foreman's sense of irony is back. I was wrong about the ethnic reason. Step one  change your name back. Step two  if step one fails  move to Bangalore. Step fourteen, if step Thirteen doesn't work, kill yourself.",11,43
So what now? You gonna insult your way through his Rolodex till you find someone with an answer?,I've been polite to the friends I've called. All of whom were useless.,18,13
"MS. Weakens myelin sheath, compromises nerve conduction. I'm talking about Charlotte, the one who's still alive.","You two, stick her in an MRI. Confirm MS. And you, run the echo on Eddie that you're planning to do behind my back to see if his heart's improving.",16,30
"You two, stick her in an MRI. Confirm MS. And you, run the echo on Eddie that you're planning to do behind my back to see if his heart's improving.",Did you let me hire a pervert?,30,7
Did you let me hire a pervert?,Kutner's police background check from when he started. He was charged with indecent exposure.,7,14
"Kutner streaked at the Penn-Dartmouth football game. Precisely the kind of thing you'd expect him to do. It's okay. You should be upset. He thought like you, pushed boundaries like you ","If he thought like me, he would know that living in misery sucks marginally less than dying in it.",32,19
"For the record, I'm uncomfortable violating a dead colleague's dignity.",It's only violating it if you find something. Good to see you.,10,12
Shame? Fear? Are you okay? It's okay not to be okay.,"""Colonial Warrior Blaster. Number One One."" He spent months tracking this down. He had passions.",11,15
He was obviously in pain. Does it really matter why?,"He hung the bad with the good. His loss beside a reminder of what he'd gained. Means he was open about the pain. Should mean that if it got worse, he had no reason to hide it.",10,37
"Here's how we're going to handle this, House. We're going to leave here and go to the closest bar and drink and tell stories about the time Kutner almost blew up an OR. And pass out in our own sick. Sound like a plan?",What am I missing? You've got that look. You figured this out.,44,12
You're not here because you care about Kutner. You're here because it's a mystery. You're here for the puzzle.,What if I didn't miss anything 'cause there's nothing to miss? He didn't kill himself. He was murdered.,19,18
Autoimmne hepatitis? Did you page Foreman?,Took up Cuddy's offer of time off. Normal thyroid means no hepatitis.,6,12
"Could be Amyloidosis. Amyloid buildup hits the organs, tissue ",Her muscles wouldn't have atrophied. You run the echo on the husband?,10,12
Heart's still failing. The improvement was only temporary.,"I prefer the less subtle answer: You were right, House. So! Less time proving why hubby isn't dead, more time proving why Kutner is. Motives for murder.",8,27
House! it was a suicide. The police have already investigated.,"They investigated what they saw, not what they didn't saw. Talk to friends, classmates, pizza delivery guy. And draft Foreman. He can make calls through his tears.",10,27
Only why a Man who embraces the rational is suddenly pursuing the irrational.,She could have alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency. Run her AAT proteins.,13,10
IT's been trying to close out Kutner's email account. Apparently someone's still logged onto it.,It wasn't hard to figure out that his password was Kutner. He did what they tell you not to do.,15,20
He's coming up for parole. He's not out on parole.,Kutner testified at Every one of his hearings. The guy wouldn't be the first to see the clock ticking.,10,19
He was killed by his own gun.,"Which he bought years ago, obviously for self-defense.",7,8
In the temple. Cops found residue.,Right. The murderer would nEver try to make it look like suicide. That would be unethical. You haven't asked about my Patient.,6,22
You're waiting on an AAT protein results.,Means you checked up to see that I'm still on it. You wanna transfer the case but you won't because you think it's the only thing that's holding me together. Relax. Either I'm right or I'm wrong. We'll know soon enough.,7,41
She's stable. But whatEver was left of her liver is definitely shot now. And there's no change in Eddie.,"So, thanks to her idiotic move, she's dead in 24 hours if she doesn't get a new liver.",19,18
It was selfless. She loves him.,How does that disagree with what I just said?,6,9
"No diagnosis, no liver. No liver, no living.",What do you know. It is myelofibrosis. Says so right here. Who wants to tell Cuddy?,8,16
How Many times has it worked?,I don't quite see how that's relevant. Cheese it. It's the coppers.,6,12
We're not just going to leave them to die while you fixate on Kutner.,"Technically, he's not our Patient. So I'm really only leaving her to die.",14,13
We've already explored the usual options. Shouldn't we at least explore unusual ones?,Absolutely. Don't worry. This is why God gave me two ears.,13,11
Kutner would say we should just come clean with Cuddy.,"Wow. If only he were here to say that. I'm sure Cuddy would be bound to fall for the old, ""Hey, the dead guy won't mind if we're wasting """,10,30
"Wow. If only he were here to say that. I'm sure Cuddy would be bound to fall for the old, ""Hey, the dead guy won't mind if we're wasting """,Need an incurable roMantic to talk to an incurable roMantic.,30,10
Suicide means you could have helped him. Murder lets you off the hook.,"Needs a liver. Has a liver. He can make a partial donation. The faster he agrees, the faster she gets to not die.",13,23
He dies on the table and you give her his whole liver.,"If he's gonna do this, he's gonna do this for love. I though he should talk to someone who spoke the language.",12,22
You can't do the transplant.,Only if he said no. But your urgent hovering means he said yes.,5,13
His fingers have nodules. I think his doctors misdiagnosed him.,Or you sprinkled too much wishful thinking in your tea.,10,10
Obese Man with lung cancer  Two easy explanations for his heart failure. Nodules can mean something else. Something curable.,Go back to the ER. My thanks to you and your cold feet.,20,13
You figure that out by taking off your sunglasses to the strains of a Who song?,The guy who killed Kutner's parents died of an aneurism two months ago.,16,13
Kutner hid from Everyone. You didn't get a chance to save him. No one did. Run the tests. Find out if you have a chance to save Eddie.,"Bad news. Love can't save you. On the other hand, mold can. Your heart failure was caused by a fungal infection called cardiac blastomycosis. It started as nodules in your lungs which Every doc, except one, mistook for cancer. It's very rare, very curable. I'm starting you on itraconazole.",28,49
But how come I was getting better without the medicine?,Your emotional state bumped your Catecholamines which helped raise your prolactin.,10,11
I don't want the treatment. Do the transplant.,But you'd be trading the certainty that you'll live for the uncertainty that she'll live.,8,15
I was ready to die anyway.,Now you get to be nicer to your next wife.,6,10
"That's your way of convincing us to do this, by saying it's no more immoral?",The idiot is gonna do this with or without us. This way we can protect the organ.,15,17
We should be protecting him.,"So we strap him to the bed, wait till his wife dies?",5,12
Infection means we have a new clue.,And a full two or three hours to figure it out.,7,11
Sarcoidosis hits the spleen and the liver.,She would have lung issues.,7,5
You don't know that ,Either we have all the clues and we're idiots or we don't have all the clues.,5,16
Why are you doing this?,"I don't actually need to know who it was. I just need to know that you went so we can know that you have visceral leishManiasis. But since Lancelot there was ready to die for you, he might want the answer to both.",5,43
Last year! It was nobody you know. Rio was supposed to be ours. I got tired of waiting. I'm so sorry.,"Start her on antimony and have Cuddy find her a liver. They were ready to die. But for guilt, not love.",21,21
You worked with him Every day for two years and you nEver saw this coming.,No one saw it coming.,15,5

He's seen three different specialists.,Interesting. Almost as interesting as you trying to step into Kutner's shoes just days after he stepped out of them.,5,20
"If he was trying to fake an illness, why would he consent to be seen by the best diagnostician in the country?","Now who's trying to get her hybrid waxed? We need to do a vestibular caloric test.

That's normal. Sometimes this test causes vertigo and nausea.,Cameron just brought me a case.,9,6
"Cameron is happy in the ER. There's no way she wants her nose back on your grindstone. Egg white omelet, no bacon, whole wheat toast.",I say it's not my grindstone she's after. And not her nose she wants on it. She and Chase are practically living together. What did you just order?,25,28
Yes. But I don't like eating the same thing two days in a row.,Your bro's nurse not lovin' the love handles?,14,8
"I'm just not in the mood for bacon. And you're obviously trying to avoid talking about Kutner. Which is odd, because you spent a whole week obsessing about why ",He's no longer on my team. I'm sorry he's no longer on my team. Nothing else to talk about.,30,19
You're wearing the watch he gave you for Secret Santa.,"Five functions, including a stopwatch to time how long it takes you to ask me if I'm okay.",10,18
And you know this because ,"She changed her shoes. If he was faking, he'd have vomited on the other side of the bed.",6,18
Could also be our only warning before a massive stroke.,"Do a Holter and a carotid Doppler. See if his heart skips for more than the spotted owl. Although I didn't say ""we."" If I had! Cameron leaves instead.",10,29
No sight of heart or arterial pRoblems but he's been hiccupping on and off for over a week.,"Nice. I'm hooked. You can get back to your shift at the ER. Except, as far as the ER is concerned, you're on vacation, right?",18,25
I postponed a trip because I'm concerned about the Patient.,"Explains why you ditched Chase and came to differentials, not why you ran the tests.",10,15
I care about the Patient and I care about the people who work on your team. They've been through a lot lately. I just thought I ,Was Florence Nightingale. Yeah. You're gonna nurse us back to spiritual and mental oneness. That would make sense if we were having this conversation a week ago.,27,27
"Think what you want  that I'm here to get a job, that I'm here to wrap you in swaddling clothes.","The pRoblem is, I think neither. Because neither makes sense. The only thing that does! doesn't.",21,16
Brain would connect the two.,"It could, if Cameron hadn't already CT'd his head. Empty as her boyfriend's calendar.",5,14
It's possible it's not connected to a protest. MS wouldn't show on the CT and his name's Swenson. Scandinavians have an increased susceptibility to MS.,Better theory than he's faking it. The clogs have it. Do a lumbar puncture to confirm MS.,25,17
I guess we'll just continue to twiddle our thumbs.,"God, I hope that's a euphemism.",9,6
How am I supposed to do a lumbar puncture on a Patient with intractable hiccups?,I'm trying to figure out what that could be a euphemism for. You'll find a way.,15,16
"I'm, uh, Doug Swenson's wife.",His history said the environmental kamikaze was single.,5,8
He's in jail a lot. Not so often in the hospital. I searched his e-mail and I found the referral to you yesterday.,You must really love your husband and travel by rickshaw. It only took you 18 hours to get here. Who eats kale? It's so bland it doesn't Even taste like kale.,23,31
"Uh, I had to find somebody to take care of our four-year-old son. Doug's all right, isn't he?",I have no idea. I know he's an idiot. And now I've learned that he's a liar. So we're making a  Who told you I was in here?,18,29
The doctor in the office next to yours said that you might be here.,I got it figured out.,14,5
That mean we don't need to do the LP.,I was talking to her. You're not Even supposed to be here.,9,12
You want us to stop or not?,"What? Oh, I don't care what you do with him. You're not doing a favor for a doctor in Philly. You're doing a favor for an oncologist in North Jersey.",7,30
Wilson sees you ten times more than I do. He's a better liar and he wouldn't have to cancel a vacation to do it.,Good points. Also doesn't explain the diet.,24,7
What does any of this have to do with my husband?,Nothing. Meet Mrs. Environmental Nutbag. Or did you keep your maiden name?,11,12
It's torticollis. Reaction to the chlorpromazine.,It's not just a spasm. It's swollen. Crunchy.,6,8
"Most likely, it was there all along. We just didn't notice it till the other symptoms made it worse.","So, what causes loss of balance, pathological hiccups, and a hole in his Gloria Steinem?",19,15
He was protesting a lumber mill last fall. Sarcoid's been linked to pine forests.,No. His A.C.E. lEvels were normal.,14,6
"Progressive systemic sclerosis. Guy practically lives in industrial waste sites. If a solvent got absorbed through his lungs, caused an autoimmune firestorm!",Start him on IV methyl-prednisolone for systemic sclerosis. Do a full work-up to confirm.,22,14
"Come on in, House. Because who else is it going to be at 10:30 at night? And, no thanks, I already ate.",Didn't ask you to dinner.,22,5
"But you were going to. And, when I explained that I'd eaten hours ago, you were going to move on to your real entre, rifling through my kitchen.",Hmmm. Inviting me to search your kitchen. Means that you know that I'd find nothing. Or that you know I'd find something so you're hoping that I'm going to assume the former and I won't bother to look.,28,38
"Or it means it's late, I'm tired, I know you're here to advance some paranoid theory based on a single egg white omelet, and I'd like to get it over with so we can both go to sleep.",Your single omelet theory conveniently overlooks the grassy knoll you had for lunch today. Vegetable and grain gag-athon.,38,18
The Warren Commission found no evidence of a second lunch. Possibly because it was stolen from the doctor's lounge.,You're not getting any fatter. Your medical records were clean.,19,10
You checked my  ?,"You're alone tonight, so it's Kutner.",5,6
How could Kutner have any conceivable ,"Your Patients live, your Patients die. You float above it all like a medical colossus. But a fellow doctor dies!",7,20
And! Ice cream is ice cream. Full fat content. Quadruple fat content.,Stuff you haven't eaten just proves you haven't eaten it.,12,10
What are you doing to him?,I assume they were checking for vascular pulsations. Either it's negative or he's a big wuss.,6,16
"But the bone covering might not be! If it's osteomyelitis, an infection eating away at his periosteum ",That explains the pain. Odds are it's a subclinical infection that we made worse with the steroids we gave him. Start him on IV antibiotics. X-ray his legs to confirm osteomyelitis.,18,31
Cameron's already done a full set of lower-body x-rays.,The infection obviously flared. Do 'em again.,9,7
Since when does bone cancer cause hiccups?,Which means it's not bone cancer.,7,6
"House is right. It'd be hard to find a guy outside Chernobyl who'd been exposed to more carcinogens. Pesticide plants, nuclear waste sites.",Tell Chase to repair the break. You two prep him for chemo.,23,12
You want to blast him with chemo for a cancer we don't Even know he has?,Nope. I wanna blast him for with chemo for a cancer that explains the symptoms.,16,15
Why are you prepping him for chemo?,The more interesting question is why do you care?,7,9
You're not Even sure that it's ,"What I mean is, why do you care from here? You can monitor the Patient from home. What's the difference between here and home?",7,24
You're not at my home. This has nothing to do with ,"Any other differences? Hmm! there's less medical equipment, more training bras, and more Vegemite sandwiches. Actually, technically, right now, Chase is here. But that's because I called him, and you didn't know that. And it's irrelevant to my point. Which is! You and Chase are over.",12,46
He's gonna ask me to marry him. I was looking for some thick socks. Found the ring.,And you want to say no. So I circle right back to his single drawer of clothes ,17,18
Her breasts are really tender.,You guys have a hot tub?,5,6
He doesn't. What's wrong with her?,Sorry. I'm sure she's got a medical crisis. And I need more time to figure out some leading questions for your wife.,6,22
What's going on with Cameron?,She doesn't want back on my team and she doesn't want to jump me.,5,14
"This isn't a medical crisis, is it?","Could be. A lot of STDs hang in the balance. I give up. Vinegar compresses four times a day. Any chance I could just leave it at that? No. Pseudomonas folliculitis. It's a skin infection from crowded and contaminated hot tubs, which you obviously use, but not with your husband. Tried to help a sister out.",7,56
"It's gotta be, except it's not. The biopsy was negative.",Biopsies can be wrong. Symptoms can't.,10,6
All signs point to cancer but you can't blast a cancer you can't find.,Sure you can. Prep him for total body irradiation.,14,9
You do realize that's insane.,Not unless you think the cancer's clEverly hiding outside his body.,5,11
"And if he doesn't have cancer, we could cause one or destroy his immune system altogether. The guy could die from an infected toenail.","You'd rather do nothing, just let him die on his own?",24,11
That's like pouring gasoline on a fire. At least total body irradiation's an actual treatment.,His idea is better. Pour away.,15,6
Have you retraced your steps? Does your cleaning lady check your pockets before ,I was clueless about Kutner. I was wrong about Cameron. Taub just came up with an idea that I should have seen long before he did.,14,26
No one saw anything coming with Kutner. You hardly Ever see Cameron anymore. And you hired Taub to come up with ideas that you wouldn't have come up with.,And I have no idea why you're eating carrots.,29,9
Nothing on the echo. We drew a troponin lEvel. No signs of myocardial ischemia. All the tests were normal.,"Loss of balance. Pathological hiccups. Air leak between the lungs. Broken femur. Now tachycardia. Go! Come on, give me something. Give me a bad idea. Maybe I can turn it into a good one. Fine. Open him up and put in a defibrillator.",19,43
"That's perManent and risky. We don't Even know what, if anything, is wrong with his heart.","Redo all the tests. In the meantime, open him up, put in a defibrillator so he can live long enough for you to finish the tests.",16,26
"Redo all the tests. In the meantime, open him up, put in a defibrillator so he can live long enough for you to finish the tests.","Balance, organs, nerves, lungs, bones, heart.",26,6
Things you use to make bratwurst.,There's no sign of infection. It's not a metabolic or autoimmune disease. It's definitely not cancer. I think.,6,18
I'm thinking. Is there a ticking clock?,You already put your money in. You nEver do that until you decide.,7,13
That's very observant of you. Too bad you distracted me. Now I'm! thinking I might change my mind.,There's nothing healthy in that maParkne.,18,6
"Oh, fine. Then I won't offer you any.","You Manipulative bitch. You're not suddenly eating healthy because you want to. You're eating healthy because you know I don't want to. I've been mooParkng food for ten years. Now, either it suddenly started bothering you this week or you're ",8,41
"It means, Even if we figure this out, you'll have to stop protesting anywhere not near a hospital.",Hi! Got a few questions.,18,5
"Uh, we're about to start doing ","A hopefully pointless medical procedure. Your life and my mojo hang in the balance. Pesticides are evil, which means that commercial flowers are doused in evil. But plant life is nature's answer to evil. So you have a garden.",7,39
Nothing. The commercial growers ,"Yeah, yeah. They're evil. Yeah, got it.",5,7
You wanna get to your point?,"She's had enough. She's gonna leave. Or maybe she's jut not putting out. WhatEver. You gotta make it right, right away. You gotta compromise that precious flower principle.",6,28
Once. Three weeks ago. Our anniversary. I missed the dinner to be at that rally. You planned it for months. You were mad. Really mad. I bought you flowers. I brought them home. You were gone. So was your suitcase. I tossed them and bought you the earrings.,"Roses? Yes. You have sporotrichosis. It's an infection from the thorn of the rose which, by any other name, is still a cheap marital aid.",48,25
The flowers are what gave me ,Lesion on your eighth cranial nerve knocks out your balance. Another on your phrenic nerve gives you serial hiccups. We then spread it to your bones and heart with steroids and insulin-like growth factor.,7,34
Please tell us that this is good news.,It's good news for him. It's good news for future generations. It's crappy news for you. He's gonna be fine. And he'll nEver doubt himself again.,8,26
He almost died. He can't take a few days at home with his family?,People only change after trauma if they wanted to change before the trauma. Or if they've watched too Many afterschool specials.,14,21
I told you I nEver wanted to dump Chase.,"Absolutely. You want him to dump you. It's totally different. Much less guilt. Either way, you're out of reasons to avoid him. Kutner was a pretty dumb one to begin with.",9,31
House. House. I know you're not asleep.,That insight would be a lot more impressive if you weren't just a product of my exhausted brain.,7,18
Aren't you curious about why I'm here?,Curious why no French maid's outfit. No spanky pants.,7,9
"I'm a hallucination, not a fantasy.",It's insomnia. Four nights without REM sleep can cause,6,9
That might explain why you're hallucinating. Doesn't explain why you're hallucinating Wilson's dead girlfriend.,PRobably just my secret and very unconscious desire to get Wilson into my bedroom.,14,14
Or maybe your guilt over Kutner's suicide reminds you how guilty you felt about me.,"Who cares why you're here. A decent night's sleep, you won't be.",15,12
Deaf 14-year-old started hearing imaginary explosions.,"Exploding head syndrome. Cool. Well, obviously his brain knows how to hear.",6,12
"No, doubt it. He was a sperm donor. Medical records couldn't be cleaner.",So we're left with temporal lobe seizure.,13,7
Someone at the wrestling meet would have noticed a seizure.,Could have just looked like a bad shot to the leg. Put him in the seizure lab. See if his head blows up all over again.,10,26
You're going to ignore your own subconscious? Gonna be the limp leading the blind.,I need a scrip for sleeping pills. My neighbor's dog's been keeping me awake and seems strangely invulnerable to poison. Why is the soon-to-be-second-prettiest Dr. Chase here?,14,27
Why did he close that file?,Wedding in two weeks? I'd say you were pregnant but I don't think Chase's body is mature enough to produce sperm.,6,21
Chase's best Man doesn't get here till the day of the wedding so I asked Wilson to throw his bachelor party.,No retired ministers available to plan it?,21,7
"Chase doesn't want some big, raucous party.","So she says. Luckily, there are people in this world ready to stand up for what's right.",7,17
"No, no, no. I don't want  I don't want you to",Listen. There are two things I do well. Bachelor parties rank! towards the top.,12,14
"Doctors, doctors. He can't see. One of his eyes.",The limp leading the blind.,9,5
Is that supposed to mean something?,So exploding head syndrome plus vision loss.,6,7
We should do an angio,"Knock yourselves out. How did I know he was gonna go blind? Don't get cute, Gazoo. You're in my mind. You're obviously there.",5,23
C-reactive protein. I noticed in his file it was slightly elevated. I figured the stress of the seizure lab would drive inflammation Even higher. Lead to optic neuritis.,"That's a lot clearer than ""the limp leading the blind.""",28,10
It was just a glimmer. I couldn't put it into words.,It was a long shot. I don't Even remember the c-reactive protein lEvel.,11,13
"House, what are you doing?",What does it look like I'm doing? Fighting the power.,5,10
"You're an ass. He says he feels the vibrations in his abdomen, but not his hands. What does that mean?",It's a new symptom. Neuropathy.,20,5
Could be increased ICP from a brain tumor.,That we missed on the head CT?,8,7
Cutting weight for wrestling could have led to rhabdomyolysis.,He just went up a weight class three months ago.,9,10
It also puts a new symptom on the table.,His deafness. What if it was caused by NF2 cancer instead of his Parkldhood meningitis?,9,15
So meningitis was a coincidence?,Or a byproduct of the cancer suppressing his immune system. MRI his head.,5,13
"Imaging shows slightly elevated ICP, but no masses on or around the nerves. It's not cancer.",Slight bowing in the wall of the fourth ventricle could still indiCate a tumor.,16,14
Taub's right. It's not cancer.,"Yeah, by all means, abandon a great diagnostic theory because it's difficult to prove. Do a biopsy. We need to take a better look at his fourth ventricle.",5,28
The main reason my third wife and I eloped was to avoid House's bachelor party. Have you seen Caligula?,My Patient's brain now! versus three years ago. See any difference? Is he telling you to avoid the party?,19,19
I took an oath to do no harm.,Sure. Don't come. If you want your wedding vows to be meaningless.,8,12
"You'd need to do a brain biopsy to confirm. Uh, I'm not going to the bachelor party. Every time I go to one of your parties, I end up embarrassing myself in some new and unexpected way.",That whole thing with the duck was hardly unexpected.,37,9
Do you know who we need? That stripper you got for Wilson's bachelor party. You could do body shots right off her.,"Why go back to that well? In the nine years since Wilson's party, a whole new generation of hot girls have been abused by their stepfathers.",22,26
"Ahem, House? You, uh, entertaining yourself up there?",Just rehearsing for the revival of Evita. What'd you find?,8,10
He has no idea what he's missing. His mom's a moron. He's gonna pay for her stupidity for the rest of his life? Are we okay with that?,Why are you closing? Supposed to put in a cochlear implant.,28,11
Her son didn't want the implant.,"If he still doesn't want it, after having time to adjust, I'll take it out. I'll blind him too if he wants to experience that culture.",6,26
"Understand, Dr. House? House. Focus. I need you to say you accept the arrangement.",No pRoblem. You're not mad.,14,5
Why did you do this?,Because he is ignorant and he's being raised by an idiot.,5,11
Not good enough. You always have,My Patient is opting into a handicap! It's an insult to all the other gimps out there.,6,17
You think we did the wrong thing?,I'm not sure. I'm not Even sure why we did it.,7,11
Why did you do it?,"Why did I give a huMan being the power of hearing? You ask God the same question, he'll give you the same answer.",5,23
Go ahead. Start him on ribavirin for Epstein-Barr.,Keep making decisions like that. It really bolsters the illusion that you're in charge.,8,14
Keep making decisions like that. It really bolsters the illusion that you're in charge.,Why aren't you in my office?,14,6
"Because I know what the word ""my"" means.","I did something insane, and you're not all over me analyzing why.",8,12
And you're okay with that?,What choice do I have?,5,5
"Kid's dehydrated but stable. Thankfully, the fountain of whiz seems to have stopped for the moment.",Not before hosing Epstein-Barr off the table. Now eat up. We're gonna pick out the ice cream flavors for the bachelor party.,16,22
"Could be systemic autoimmune disease, sarcoido  This tastes like! vodka.","Well, it would be stupid if it tasted like bourbon. That's the brown one.",11,14
"It happened at night. That was the clue. Night, recumbent body position, changes in BP","It's his heart. Run a 12-lead EKG, watch him for four hours. Foreman concurs.",15,14
"It's his heart. Run a 12-lead EKG, watch him for four hours. Foreman concurs.",What the hell just happened? Everything started to fade away.,14,10
You're getting better at focusing. Ignoring Everything that doesn't matter. Uh-oh. He looks pissed. I think he might hit us.,Is your eyesight better than mine?,20,6
We need to talk about the bachelor party.,Excellent topic choice. Surgery's so boring and my lying to you is just so yesterday.,8,15
It's my fault for letting you talk me into the implant. Cameron is not going to be happy about this party.,"But you, on the other hand",21,6
Plan on spending the rest of my life with Cameron.,So! I need to cancel the fart band?,10,8
So! I need you to kidnap me.,"Spoken like a true Aussie. By the way, if you know where I can get me the sheet music to Waltzing Matilda! Hey. Want some ice cream? We're having a sundae bar.",7,32
The Patient just had brain surgery. A stress test could cause a brain bleed and kill him.,I value your opinion. I value rejecting your opinion.,17,9
You're not doing this. You haven't been sleeping,Cuddy doesn't actually want you in charge. She just wants to avoid a lawsuit and to win an NAACP award.,8,20
"And if I let you risk our Patient's life testing an organ we already tested, we accomplish neither. Run a thyroid panel.",How do we get him into the stress lab without Foreman's sign-off.,22,12
We could kill Foreman. Is she new?,Focus. The lab simulates stress. What if it's not simulated?,7,10
We could tell him his girlfriend dumped him.,That's a tough sell since she nEver leaves the room for more than five minutes.,8,15
We could kill her. Or! Asthma meds. Force the heart to beat faster.,REvealing the arrhythmia. Nice idea.,13,5
You were right about the heart. Should have listened to you.,"The correct phrasing would be, ""I should always listen to you.""",11,11
"First symptom, wrestling. Then, under the lights of the seizure lab",Are you going somewhere with this? Because this feels,11,9
"Just keep doing what you're doing. It helps. Then, under the stress of blindness! and post-op fEver. What do all the symptoms have in common?","Heat. See, if you hadn't been here that would have just popped into my head. Which actually would have been way cooler. Foreman. The kid's got Uhthoff Phenomenon. Which means it's MS. Start him on double-dose interferon.",25,37
Let's get our drink on.,"Not before I've added ""chemical burns"" to this guy's cause of death.",5,12
Don't let House get him in too much trouble.,Allow me to welcome you to the best night of your life.,9,12
This is my apartment. You can't do this.,"Clearly, reality begs to differ.",8,5
"You should be out there, enjoying the lap dances of your labors.",Eh. I kinda like it in here.,12,7
"Me too. To us, figuring out MS.",And the blindness and neuropathy and arrhythmia and anything else we did. What exactly did my team do?,7,18
"One of the residents had an epi pen, so he's fine but we're taking him to the hospital to be safe.","Okay. I knew that Chase was allergic to strawberries, didn't I? That's why you wanted Karamel at this party.",21,19
I suggested Karamel 'cause she was great at Wilson's party.,I knew about her body butter. I knew about his strawberry allergy. I tried to kill Chase. Why would I do that? I don't want Cameron.,10,26
"You're not a big fan of other people's happiness, either.",Hello. You confirm? Thanks. That kid we saved! He's dying. It's not MS. We were wrong.,10,16
I'm you. You can't just shut a door.,You tried to kill Chase. I need to push you back down. You're dangerous.,8,14
Usually responds to corticosteroids and methotrexate. I'll start the meds.,I need sleeping pills. I was gonna hit up Wilson but he's not answering his phone.,10,16
"Your Patient's doing fine, thanks to your team.","It wasn't eosinophilic pneumonitis, was it?",8,6
"House, please talk to me.",I haven't slept through the night since Kutner killed himself.,5,10
"Are you going to ignore me all day, again? I help you.",You tried to kill Chase.,12,5
"Doing what you wanted. That's all, boss. I exist.","No, you don't. I acknowledge my subconscious exists. Now go away.",9,11

Twenty-one year old star of the New York Ballet collapsed on stage.,"I love ballet but, as someone may have mentioned, I'm taking a personal day.",12,14
She's a dancer. What about dehydration?,What about a pulmonary contusion?,6,5
"Hey. I'm just the irrational part of your brain but elevated means high, right? Dehydration could hide an infection.",Dehydration could hide an infection. Go treat her for the obvious. IV fluids and antibiotics for the pneumonia.,19,18
The door was closed for a reason.,"Well, now it's open for a reason. We need to talk.",7,11
He just told me I have kidney cancer.,Then you'll obviously need a moment to process.,8,8
I'm! I'll be right back.,"I need you to sit in on my differentials, double-check Everything I do.",5,13
You shouldn't be practicing. At least!,Enough! Don't give me the look. I told you I was hallucinating.,6,12
Who were you talking to?,Someone who's not actually here. Beyond that seems irrelevant.,5,9
Good choice. He feels bad.,You gonna help me or not?,5,6
I know you're wrong about sleep apnea which means you know you're wrong about sleep apnea. You're scared. Tell him you're scared.,Can't sleep with you here.,22,5
Patient's not responding to the antibiotics. Still can't breathe.,So run a test to confirm it's pneumonia.,9,8
"An infection can be treated. Cured. Means you still got a job. Means you still got a life. Doesn't make it a better idea, just a nicer one. This the rational you talking?",Can't do this on my own.,33,6
You want us to ignore the fact that she's lost 80 of her skin?,"We know it's not lung cancer. It could be a liver tumor, eats through to the lungs. Get an ultrasound of her liver. If you find masses, get a biopsy.",14,30
We can't just ignore the skin. It's obviously the most significant and dangerous symptom right now.,I don't think it is a symptom. I think we caused it.,16,12
Toxic epidermal necrolysis. That's a one in a million reaction.,"Yeah, well, maybe this is the one. Get swabs of her old skin to confirm.",10,15
"Yeah, well, maybe this is the one. Get swabs of her old skin to confirm.",Where the hell were you?,15,5
I do have a practice.,Ballerina has toxic epidermal necrolysis.,5,5
"Any other doctor? Words can hurt, you know.",I have no reason to feel guilty. It doesn't make any sense. Unless there's something wrong in the limbic area of my brain.,8,23
"It's consistent with MS. And, since the blood tests were negative! I have to apologize. If I feel better then you're right, I was feeling an emotion. If I feel nothing, it means my limbic brain is shot.",I'm Doctor House. Anyone explain to you your status?,38,9
She's half dead and she's wondering if she'll Ever plie again? Healthy priorities. Let the mocking begin.,I'm sorry. I treated you for an infection before confirming that you had one. That's why you lost your skin. I know you're in pain. I know that I caused it. I'm sorry.,17,33
Maybe you didn't mean it.,I meant it. Did you do a liver biopsy to confirm?,5,11
Couldn't. The artificial skin was too thin. She'd bleed out. Why were you talking to the Patient?,"I think skinless women are hot. Do a trans-jugular liver biopsy. If she bleeds, at least it stays in her veins.",17,21
Did you just check with Wilson again?,No. I felt nothing. It's MS.,7,6
Apologies aren't supposed to make you feel better. They're supposed to make the other person feel better.,In order to make you feel better.,17,7
"It's not MS. SEvere mental illness and Vicodin are all that's left. Mental illness means you can no longer practice medicine. Vicodin means detox, which means pain for the rest of your life. Which means you can no longer practice medicine.",Are you saying we should kill her?,41,7
Your subconscious picked my dead girlfriend?,Yeah. The irrational part of my brain works like the rational part of yours. How about that.,6,17
Everybody gets competing ideas. Everybody has doubts.,"So is it regular radical, me radical or me out of my mind radical?",7,14
It's on the upper end of you radical. Do you have any alternative?,Nothing that anyone in my head has come up with.,13,10
Then you're as safe as you can be.,Great. You get the LP results back?,8,7
Not an argument. He knows that's not an argument.,It could still be sParkzophrenia.,9,5
You'd prefer electroshock therapy to rehab?,I'd prefer something that could actually work.,6,7

"If you had psychosis, which you don't.","I've had no diarrhea, no sweating, no vomiting. None of the symptoms of Vicodin overdose.",7,15
"Yeah, except the ""I see dead people"" thing.",I've been popping pills for years. I've only been seeing things for days. Something changed.,8,15
Vicodin addiction is still more likely.,"So, we're no longer dealing in absolutes.",6,7
"House, I'll be up in five minutes. Then we can talk about how you'd rather be in a coma than in rehab.","Actually, if you could be up here in two, that'd be really helpful.",22,13

At bridge. My wife and I play a lot of bridge.,Why you worked on a case last time I was here.,11,11
I gave you a theory. Just like I'd help a guy who needs a Heimlich in a restaurant. And then I shut the door behind you.,"But you'd knock over three other doctors to give it to him. Metaphorically speaking, you're a Heimlich addict.",26,18

What were you wrong about?,You spent weeks elaborately concealing the fact that you... crashed daddy's car. And then you just confessed. Seemed idiotic. Certain to end in disaster. Instead you're riding off into the sunset together. Any theories on why?,5,36
"I assume you've already dismissed the ""she loves me"" theory?","Well, it's possible. It would require the presupposition that Everything she's done for the last six years has been completely inconsistent with her character, but yeah, it's possible.",10,28
"And as we've already established, it's also possible that you're wrong.","Or there's another explanation. Since you don't have one, I'm gonna keep looking for you.",11,15

"And now you expect me to ask you what the ""too"" refers to.","Only if you're interested. Only if you have doubts about her answer. She thinks that you don't have anything to feel guilty about, because you didn't kill anybody. I did. She blames me for Dibala's murder, not you.",13,38
You were barely involved in that case. She knows that.,"But I created the big, bad, evil climate that allowed it to happen.",10,13
Why are you doing this? Why are you trying to screw things up?,"You got the tense wrong. Things are already screwed up. Which is why you don't just want to work for me, you need to.

Why are you doing it this way? You're pretending to assume we're all coming back without actually asking us. Why?,"See, this is why you'd be miserable wiping noses in a clinic.",20,12
You can't ask because you can't face the rejection. Why not? What's going on?,Are you asking me to ask you?,14,7
Which means it could be a hematological pRoblem plus cardiomyopathy.,"No, neck veins are flat, precordial exam was normal.",10,9

The answer has nothing to do with the question.,Then it's not technically the answer.,9,6

"Dr. Taub, comma, Christopher Michael.",So this is what it comes down to in the final hours. Deifying some lost love. Hoping to get her on the phone and make Everything perfect. It's pathetic. Either you left her for a reason or she left you for a reason. A phone call is not ,5,49

Why would he fake anything?,"Kryo podia. It's Greek for ""duh."" Still, you get to keep the engagement ring.",5,14
I don't think he was faking.,"That's because you're more gullible than I am. For instance, I don't beliEve that you called off your open marriage. I beliEve your wife called it off, and you called off telling her that you weren't calling it off. A guy doesn't just throw a golden ticket in the trash.",6,50
The same way a guy doesn't give up a lucrative medical practice to come work for you?,That's exactly why you dabble. You're compensating for your professional conquests with sexual ones.,17,14
You won't Even consider it?,"I did, just very quickly.",5,5
"The truth is, since I called this thing off, my wife has been very grateful and I could do with a down night. If I go out with the boss, nobody can blame me.",Okay. If you bring your wife.,34,6

ER ruled out infection. Eosinophil count ruled out parasites.,A medication he's not telling us about.,9,7
"You really don't trust this guy, do you?","I don't Even trust the ER. Let's rule out infections ourselves. Tap his lungs, send cultures, run cytology for cancer, and check his blood pressure.",8,25
He just moved in with his fiancee three months ago. Toxic exposure could take longer than that to Manifest.,You check his love nest. You two check his swinging bachelor pad.,19,12
Lung tap turned up mononucleosis. ER doesn't routinely test for it. It explains the PE and can be virtually asymptomatic.,"So we got to wondering, how does a 27-year-old get mono? You're a little old for the kissing disease, unless your immune system is compromised.",20,25

They gave him electroconvulsive therapy to make him straight?,To zap the fabulous right out of him.,9,8
ECT doesn't cause neural damage.,Unless it was done at Dr. Liberace's he-Man quackery camp. Run an EEG. See if they straightened him or just scrambled him.,5,22
Sorry. I completely forgot. My wife just started a ceramics class Tuesdays at 8:00. It's a half-hour drive from here. She won't be back till 10:30. She's taking it with her girlfriend Marly. She hopes to make a tea service. You want to call her?,No need. I already texted her. And here she is now.,45,11
No need. I already texted her. And here she is now.,I think you're still seeing the physio. You've got a backup suit in your car. Don't want to be bringing home da stank.,11,23
"Hi, Dr. House. I didn't know you'd be here. Hi, Honey. Got your text, obviously.",I'm just leaving. I've got a ceramics class.,15,8
So what caused the arrest?,"Four ways to stop a heart. Electrical pRoblems, restricted blood flow, blood where it shouldn't be, shocks, blocks, or bleeds.",5,20
I think that's three things.,"And cheating. Oh, no. Sorry. That's how you break a heart.",5,11
I found a ceramics class in Trenton on Friday nights that was full so my wife couldn't join me. EP study ruled out shocks.,"Now you just have to find some pottery by Taub. The lamer it looks, the better.",24,16
So we'll do an angio to see if it's blocks or bleeds.,You should be a doctor.,12,5
I'm doing it to help you.,By setting me up with a hottie that I can't sleep with? And Thirteen?,6,14
I've been spending more time with Sam. I know it's been hard on you. I figured if you had some company,I don't need your help.,21,5
Then consider it helping our neighbor's four-year-old.,I gave him a dollar. How much did you have to pay?,7,12
"Nothing. I just told them you might be feeling down and it was in their self-interest to keep you company. 100 bucks, Foreman held out for 2. House, I'm worried about you. You could have ended up in jail or worse.",Racking you with guilt. So I do something really stupid and you reward me. Read any parenting Manual. That's not helping me. That's helping you.,41,25

So load him up with fludrocortisone.,"You didn't read your ceramics course description, did you?",6,9
"That's what we're thinking. Cerebral infection would explain the headaches, could have caused P.O.T.S. If it's fungal, it could have spread to the heart.",I was talking about you. Has the little gent been wearing a tent?,24,13
Remind me why that has anything to do with you.,A distracted person makes a distracted professional.,10,7

"Trust me, she's not straight.","If your gaydar is so great, how come you didn't know about the Patient till you met his boyfriend?",5,19
The guy walked in with his bride. It took me a while to rotate my dish. It's unbelievable what he's doing to her.,You don't think he loves her?,23,6
"He may love her, but he needs to have sex with other men.","Taub loves his wife, but he needs to have sex with other women.",13,13
"Yeah, it sucks what he's doing to her too, but it's hardly the same. To be faithful to his wife, our Patient has to deny his identity. Taub just needs to",to resist a biological imperative.,31,5

"Oh, yeah. My life's a breeze.","You're successful, smart, and you attract Everything that moves. If you want to focus on the fact that you're not gonna see 50, that's your choice.",6,26
"CSF was negative for infection, and his headaches are worse.",We were just talking about you.,10,6
"It's not P.O.T.S., we're back to square one.","Not quite. You did a spinal tap, but the headaches got worse.",8,12
We're maxing him out on morphine.,He sprung a leak. He's losing CSF from the tap site.,6,11
That still wouldn't explain why he got the headaches in the first place.,"The low pressure in his brain caused the P.O.T.S., not the other way around. Patch the leak and top him up with artificial CSF.",13,24
It's really not P.O.T.S. We're really back to square one.,"So what's masquerading as a stroke? Voted the worst Halloween costume, by the way.",10,14
Wasn't easy. Bought a suitably cruddy set of fife and drum napkin rings online. Scleroderma?,Skin's fine. A.N.A. was negative. So what did that set you back?,15,12
Too much. I got into a bidding war with some lunatic. Histoplasmosis.,"EIA was clear. Hey, could have gone a lot higher than 215.",12,12

Its orthostatic effect was mimicking P.O.T.S.,"It also does an uncanny Christopher Walken. Unfortunately, if you treat it like P.O.T.S., it gets worse. So, as far as that goes, oops.",6,24
So how did I get this thing?,"Overbearing mother. Kidding. CM's congenital. Like so Many other things, you were born that way.",7,15
I called it off. For real this time.,Frees you up for the next one.,8,7
One day at a time. Napkin rings. My way of saying thanks.,For trying to wreck your marriage?,12,6
For trying to save it.,And I get napkin rings?,5,5
You too. Your Patient's going home tomorrow.,He doesn't have a home.,7,5
You want to grab a bite to eat?,So Wilson got to you too?,8,6
I just want us to be friends.,Funny. That's the last thing I want us to be.,7,10
"Anything been on your mind lately, any particular stress?",No. PRobably just gonna rain.,9,5
Mm-hmm. You like the new Monet reproduction in the waiting room  the Water Lilies?,"I was late. I wasn't focusing on the decor, but it sounds appropriately bland and calming.",15,16
Stress can also make you absentminded.,I'm not stressed! Beyond the stress induced by you telling me how stressed I am.,6,15
"Amnesia. She was found jogging in the street, disoriented. She almost got hit by a truck. The MRI showed no abnormalities. No I.D. on her. Just her jogging clothes and her heart rate monitor.

She just ate 15 minutes ago. She keeps forgetting.,You don't eat because you remember it's time to eat. You eat 'cause you're hungry. Her metabolism is in high gear. She is an extreme long-distance runner,9,27
Why were you in the ER?,"That's your question? You're a psychotherapist. You're hearing about a great amnesia case, and all you're asking me is geography.",6,20
I was avoiding Wilson. It's not something you couldn't have seen eight miles away.,Wilson's a processor. I knew there were some things that he'd want to process with me! at length.,14,18
In life. Sam likes you!,But she wants me to move out.,5,7
"No. I want you to move out. I didn't know things with Sam would happen so quickly. I d""I don't want to make a mistake here. I've made a lot of mistakes.","By moving too quickly. Given your usual rate of commitment, I'm surprised you're not already re-divorced.",32,16

"Nothing. I just thought! You might want to find somewhere new, somewhere!",Where I didn't abuse drugs and hallucinate.,12,7
You're not feeling a little! betrayed and angry? Wilson bought a two-bedroom condo specifically so that you could move in with him. It wasn't that long ago. You don't feel a little! jerked around?,He couldn't foresee Sam coming back into his life.,34,9
Do I need to know this?,"Fine. I'll give you the Cliff Notes version. Chase "" MS, Taub "" physical trauma. I can tell you why we ruled them out.",6,24
"Really? Uh, it's unusual for you to spend time with a Patient, isn't it?","Patients are boring! As people. This one I'm sure was no exception, but her situation was interesting. Besides, I was still avoiding Wilson. And no better way to avoid than leaving the hospital.",14,33
Maybe. Or were you avoiding going home? There's a reason they tell addicts to stay away from old geography.,I wasn't avoiding going home. I'd already gone home!,19,9
I wasn't avoiding going home. I'd already gone home!,Before I came into work that day. I went straight there from Wilson's.,9,13
"When I left Mayfield, I went back to the old neighborhood. You know, you shouldn't leave the bathroom window unlocked.","Yeah, thanks for the safety lesson. Why are you here?",20,10
"Like I said, when I went back to the neighborhood, I found out immigration was looking for me. So I decided to visit my old buddy House!",And turn his apartment into a giant prison jumpsuit.,27,9
"But still, you nEver showed up. So this week, since I'm a real good painter, I decided to",Coffee table  where'd you put it? In the bedroom?,18,10
"The paint's not cheap, House. It's a custom color. It's a mix of titanium, yellow, and ochre. Ochre  I don't Even like that stuff. It's like a fruit. It's got hair on it. But they say it's a vegetable",You sold my table to pay for paint that I don't want?,40,12
"No, papa, just give the color a chance.","Look, I'm going to work now. And when I come back, the walls will be a less exciting color, and you will be gone.",8,24
"So Wilson threw you out, and you threw Alvie out  just, uh, another week?","Unlike me, Alvie didn't leave. I took my motorcycle to work that day. When I went home to get my car, he was painting the ceiling magenta. So I brought him with me to protect the apartment.",15,37
"Tossing him out or, uh, sending him to the movies or, uh, locking him in the bathroom would also minimize Alvie's destructive force. But you chose his company deliberately. Why?","Obviously because he's a Wilson substitute. You can barely tell the difference between them, especially when Wilson raps about the hood.",30,21
Maybe the heart rate monitor was a gift. That's why no one recognized her.,"Shut up, Alvie. Anything familiar! Church, grocery store?",14,8
"It's okay, Ms. X. Maybe she's nEver been to this town before, bought the heart rate monitor on the store's website.","You know that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, right? Instead of working the case, why don't you contemplate the inanity of an American with American immigration issues?",21,27
I had a birth certifiCate. I lost it.,So get a new one.,8,5
What if nothing Ever looks familiar?,"Then someone will show up  a spouse, a friend  to tell you who you really are and what you should be feeling. They always do.",6,27
I don't know who that is! But I miss him.,What did they say at the hearing?,10,7
I didn't go. I lied once.,"Your mother is Puerto Rican, therefore, you are Puerto Rican. All you got to do is prove your mom's your mom, find some documentation",6,24
"Everyone loves doughnuts  glazed, crullers, elephant ears, Even doughnut holes. Much better than the sporting goods store. I bet Mrs. X went there all the time.",We're not here And then I realized! You make a good point.,27,12
"Dozen glazed, dozen jelly-filled? You want the usual, right?","Your old friend, the fried carbohydrate. She needed the calorically dense food to support the running habit. Do you know her name?",9,22
Sandy! Or Shelley. I don't know. The guy she's with called her that once. I just work here.,Do you know where they live?,18,6
"The police said it was too soon to do anything, so I started calling hospitals on my own. Princeton Plainsboro wasn't Even on my list. You really think something around here could have made her sick?","Here, work, anywhere she could have been exposed. Why wasn't Princeton Plainsboro on your list?",36,15
That doesn't sound like me.,Do you have any idea what would sound like you?,5,10
So what were you thinking during all this?,"That it was a strange position to be in. At that moment, she was more comfortable with me than with her husband. And he was picking up on it.",8,29
"Well, there was a sort of, um, artificial intimacy between you? She had been dependent on you. Uh, did you find that attractive on some lEvel? Disturbing?",Those are my two choices? None of the above. She was just a Patient. She was interesting.,27,17
"You know, she just won a settlement for some families whose housing dEvelopment was built on an old methane field.",Toxic exposure to methane could explain this.,20,7
"All right, it's nothing personal. Bet she didn't think you were her type back when you first met either.","We'll take her back to the hospital, test her blood and urine and start treatment.",19,15
Seizures? This is the second diagnosis you've come up with that has a personal resonance for you.,I'm choosing my diagnoses based on personal issues? You think she fell down the stairs and peed her pants 'cause Wilson dumped her too?,17,24
"You're choosing to tell me about this case, so let's look at it. First you were fixated on a harmful toxin from her past, possibly because you're worried about a harmful toxin from your own past.",Chase had the toxin idea. Maybe he's obsessed with my past.,36,11
"And""and now you're talking about a seizure disorder?",Which is also not a toxin.,8,6
"But which is most likely caused by an old injury to the brain. Wh""why do you see your past as such a threat?","Not only am I unthreatened by it, I was trying to get it back.",23,14
It's a piece of junk. It was dinged when it came in.,"Sure, the""the cup marks and the scuffs and the paint and those three Parkps. This fourth one's new.",12,18
"I can't tell you. It's a law, and should be. Crazy bastards like you try to hunt down their stuff.",How much for the pile?,20,5
Why is it so important that you get your stuff back?,Unlike the rest of huManity! Who's okay when their belongings are taken. Everyone wants their stuff. That's why it's their stuff.,11,21
Everyone doesn't pay five times what it's worth.,I like my stuff. I hate it when Wilson moves it,8,11
"Wait, wait, wait. Wait. You seriously thought you were gonna tell me that Wilson showed up but not tell me what he said?","Because I thought you were a smart guy who didn't need the obvious spelled out to him. Wilson noticed that I didn't come to my office all day. He came to find me, wanted to make sure I'm okay  boring, boring, boring.",23,43
Yeah. It was my mother's. She died when I was four. It's all I have left.,"That's very sad, Alvie. Listen, I set up an immigration hearing.",16,11
"Um, interesting. You present yourself as, uh, not giving a damn about other people's emotions, but your actions indiCate otherwise. You dismiss Alvie's story about his mother, but you cared enough to schedule a hearing.",I cared for eight seconds. Then I got distracted.,35,9
We've kept the Patient up for 12 hours now. No hint of seizure-like activity. We should shut this down.,"Try a stRobe light, add more stress.",19,7
"Apparently, without her memory, the Patient's personality has returned to what you might call its ""natural state.""",Seems she had a wake-up call while she was at college. Her brother died in a car accident. She decided to make her life mean something. Went to law school. Now that's all gone.,17,34
The thing that caused the change is gone! So the change itself is gone.,Yeah. I knew the psychological aspects of this case would interest you. Bet you got a theory already. What is it?,14,21
Why do you care about my theory?,"I think he just! bores her. She's at an earlier stage of dEvelopment. She's looking at her grown-up future, and it puts her to sleep.",7,25
"If he just bored her, she'd hide it to be polite. Their pRoblem is synchronicity. Just like you and me, House, they're not on the same page. He talks to her like someone he shares history with. But from her point of view, he's a stranger forcing intimacy on her. Of course she doesn't like him. He's not helping. He can feel he's losing his wife, and it makes him come on stronger.",He almost did lose his wife.,73,6
And the D.I. came from damage to the hypothalamus.,"Hypothalamus here, hence the D.I. and incontinence. The Amygdala here, hence the global amnesia. And the motor cortex that's the foot paralysis. What do they all have in common?",9,29
"Okay, now you're just doing this to mess with me. What possible relevance does this differential have to your pRoblems?",It ends with a diagnosis of spongiform encephalitis. I convinced the team to cut out part of this Woman's brain. That's not interesting to you?,20,25
"Well, this is where you tell me that being cavalier with someone else's past has nothing to do with avoiding your own past. The case is irrelevant. You just found it, uh! interesting.",Aren't therapists supposed to be nurturing?,33,6
"Nowhere! is that in the Manual. Look, you""you've been in therapy for a year. You know when I ask you to talk about anything, I mean anything that affects you what upset you, what made you mad or reliEved or joyful. You want me to beliEve that this case means nothing? Then, um! why should I listen to it?",Are you charging me for this time?,59,7
What's that? On the back of your arm?,It's just a bruise. And I fell.,8,7
"Well, it looks like you fell on the tip of someone's boot.",I said something that someone objected to.,12,7
"Well, if you don't remember, then how can you","It's usually the way it is when someone hits me. People who kick when you're down are jerks, but they're generally not irrational jerks.",9,24
"You say that when you've been hit in the past, it's because you provoked it with something that you said, which means you're well aware of the risks. So on some lEvel, you were in that bar looking for someone to hurt you. Logically, people punish themselves for something they did or something they didn't do. So what! did you screw up?","I don't know. Okay, there may be a pRoblem.",62,9
"Look, the whole idea was that after Mayfield, you wouldn't be on your own. I can touch base with you a lot more easily if you're staying with me than","God's sake, Wilson. You really span the chasm from wishy to washy. If you're gonna be an ass, be an ass. Stick with it.",30,24
"Why were you being so hard on the guy, when he was being conciliatory?",Come on. Cuddy played on his guilt. She put him up to this.,14,13
How do you know that? How do you know this wasn't entirely his own idea?,"Two reasons  first, he wants to create the perfect environment to be with Sam. He's been thinking about asking me to leave for a while. Finally he does it and immediately turns around and changes his mind? No. He talked to somebody.",15,43
"Okay, um! Not Sam. Uh, that still doesn't answer why Cuddy.","Because they've been talking about me. She called me to check on the Patient, which she nEver does without a reason. I asked why, and she said!",11,27
"She's a barracuda attorney, House. These are the kind of Patients we like to keep happy.",Right now the Patient's lucky if she can spell jurisprudence.,16,10
"Yeah, but when she gets that memory back, which we are trying to make happen, she'll be able to spell lawsuit. I'm just touParkng base.",TouParkng base. Wilson used exactly the same phrase. Colluding about me is their favorite pastime.,25,15
What's Taub doing in my imaginary version of a scene with Wilson and Cuddy?,"Your version needed to be ended, 'cause it's crap. It's all sweetness and light and! faith that I'm gonna choose the right path. Yeah, that sounds like Wilson.",14,28
I have as much evidence for mine as you do for yours. I know Wilson's your friend. So he could be wondering if he did right by you. And I know he wouldn't have asked you to move out in the first place unless he was convinced you could handle life on your own.,And I know that he and Cuddy have gone behind my back before to strategize about the House pRoblem.,54,19
So there's truth in both versions. But you choose to focus on the parts that make you uncomfortable. So! Why are you and Wilson! friends? Do you think this friendship is the best you can do?,Wilson is not a consolation prize.,36,6
So what do you value in him?,"I can say whatEver I want to him, and he'll nEver leave.",7,12
"He's sort of leaving. At least, he won't be around as much! because he's putting Sam first.","For now. After the divorce, he'll pRobably ask me to move in again. I take the long view.",17,18
You say that to Wilson?,Are you kidding? That's the kind of remark that leads people to hit you.,5,14
"Uh, maybe you've been right from the beginning. Maybe this isn't about Wilson.",You say that now that I finally agree with you? Do you just argue the opposite of whatEver I say?,13,20
"I don't mean the Wilson thing doesn't, uh, bother you, uh, but it sounds like he's the closest you can come to a safe relationship. You'd have to do something major to screw it up. Um, what""what else have you been involved in this week? What would you want to punish yourself for?","I told you, I don't know.",53,6
"Okay, um, let's approach it from a different angle. Have you gotten any other people angry at you over anything?","Well, yeah. That's why I called it an ordinary week.",20,10
Why wouldn't she? Of course she's willing to risk losing her memories perManently. She has no idea how important those memories are. Does she Even know what risk is? She's nEver lost anything.,"Without the surgery, she'll lose Everything. The prion infection will continue to advance and destroy her whole brain.",33,18
"Well, there has to be another way. Please. I'm speaking for my wife, the wife I lived with for four years who isn't here and can't defend herself. Dr. House, are you listening?","Well, you can stop arguing, 'cause it doesn't matter anymore. Look at the variability in the heart rate. The S.E. has spread into the brain stem.",33,26
No. We can't cut the brain stem.,"This thing's moving too quickly. Surgery's no longer an option, which I guess means you've won. Congratulations. Put in a pacer and start her on chemo and radiation. It won't cure her, but it'll buy a couple weeks so she can find out who she is before she dies.",7,49
That was pretty rough Do you always break the news to your Patients that way? Or were you short-handing it for me?,Husband was being an idiot.,22,5
"Well, he was asking for it. But, um, to punish him you have to punish the wife too. Why""why did he make you so angry, Hmm? Because he didn't want to cooperate with you?",He'd rather risk his wife's life than their marriage. People's brains stop working when they think they're gonna lose someone they love.,34,22
Okay. Anyone else you pissed off?,50 bucks for the book.,6,5
"That's what I paid. But it's a rare surgical text, nearly 100 years old  plates in mint condition. That book's worth sEveral thousand dollars.","2,000. I'll write you a check.",25,6
We're trying to stabilize her heart. She's still tachy and hypotensive.,"Brain, heart, and rapidly progressing.",11,5
"Her extreme exercise suppresses her immune system, allows the infection to smolder.",Or allows an old infection to reactivate it  TB. Start her on a multidrug regimen.,12,16
A gentle reminder  the use of cell phones is prohibited.,Give her the first dose directly into the lungs in the O.R.,11,12
Before the less gentle arrest for contempt.,Put her in an isolation room with U.V. light. And get yourselves tested. You've all been exposed.,7,17
You faked it? It wasn't just me. You lied to them too!,I'm better at it than you are.,12,7
We need to get her on a vent.,There's something on her ankle.,8,5
"""Eddie would go."" It's a surfing phrase. Must be from her earlier life.","She tried to get it removed, but they only took off the top layers of skin. The ink is still in the deeper layers. Set off an allergic reaction. She was fine until she started the long-distance running. The ultra-marathoning modified her immune system, set off the allergic reaction. We did a full thickness skin graft, and she'll be okay.",13,60
You gonna tell me what the note said?,Alvie was very grateful that I'd gotten him out of trouble. It allowed him to go stay with his cousin in Phoenix without worrying about immigration looking for him there.,8,30
I don't know. You're the one who set the theme  something about relationships made you go out and provoke a fight. Wilson and Sam have a relationship. You're not thrilled about it.,"They're happy. Why should I screw that up? Everyone's happy. Everyone's moving in together  Wilson and Sam, Cuddy and Lucas. Even Alvie's",33,23
Cuddy and Lucas are moving in together? You didn't mention that.,They talked about moving in together before. It's not big news.,11,11
"Cuddy! Cuddy. ""Approach to the Acute Abdomen""! Written by Ernest T. Cuddy, M.D. Any relation to your Cuddy?",Her great-grandfather. I've had it for years! Always meant to give it to her for a special occasion.,18,18
"A Woman you care about is taking one step further away from you and closer to someone else? I""I think I can safely say yes, it's significant if you don't mention it. You were willing to punish the husband of your Patient because you identified with him. He was also losing someone he loved.","I'm not gonna go out and get hammered because a Woman I'm not Even with is moving in with someone. That'd be pathetic. To hell with this. When I first came to you, I told you that I wanted to be happy, and I followed your advice. And instead, I'm just miserable. How is this working for me?",54,58
"Seriously, you're giving this to us?",It's a big step you're taking. I wanted to congratulate you. I understand that's the adult thing to do.,6,19

Skull fracture. Glasgow coma score of 11. She's immediate.,Move on. This guy's dead.,9,5
Maybe his shoes were too tight.,"It's not the shoes. Skin shows smoker's facies. He's not gonna make it till morning. He'll just take up an ambulance ride, surgeon's time, and an ICU bed.",6,28
"Crane operator. Made it through amazingly well. Lucid and responsive. Stable fracture, right humerus. Haven't gotten to his lower half yet.",Tell me when something hurts.,21,5
"I fell asleep, killed all those people.","Something other than your conscience. Is that a pill in your pocket, or are you just happy to have a tiny pill-shaped penis?",7,23
"Something other than your conscience. Is that a pill in your pocket, or are you just happy to have a tiny pill-shaped penis?",Caffeine pills. You fell asleep taking these?,23,7
I drank two cups of coffee too.,Is that normal for you?,7,5
"No, I hate coffee. I'm working on no sleep. My daughter has the flu.","This much caffeine for a coffee virgin. There's no way he fell asleep. He passed out. Which means a neurological disorder caused the crash, not fatigue. Hey. We're taking the crane operator back to Princeton.",14,35
They said he was barely hurt  he can wait.,Steal an ambulance. And call the team. Tell 'em we got a case.,10,13
House. No! I need you here.,Well he needs me there. And he moans louder than you do.,6,12
Besides them moving in together? That's not enough for you?,"I gave her the Housewarming gift earlier. And she paused for a split second, like she was hiding something.",10,19
It's pRobably her moral revulsion at Housewarming gifts.,Or maybe she didn't want to accept a gift for something she wasn't gonna do.,8,15
As far as I know.,"Well, know a little farther, will you? Look into it.",5,10
"Well, know a little farther, will you? Look into it.",Hey! There's somebody down here!,10,5
There's a million voids down there. It was the Parking garage. But equipment hasn't picked up any movement. Dogs haven't picked up any scent.,There's smashed cars down there. The gasoline throw off their scent?,24,11
"Look, we gotta get back to work, okay? We'll get to this area soon. Excuse me.",Anybody hear me? Hey! Anybody hear me?,16,7
Please...my husband's gift. I was supposed to pick it up at the framers. It's on Elm.,"Well, you should have told me earlier. I could have picked it up on the way. What's your name?",16,19
It's a picture from our Tortola trip. For his birthday.,I'm not asking your name because I wanna become friends. I'm trying to gauge your mental state.,10,17
"No, stay! Someone else will come.",No one knows I'm down here.,6,6
He's still in the ER House. We haven't had time to start a differential.,Perfect! Let's start right now. Put me on speaker. What causes syncope?,14,12
Your guy's stable. The two dozen other Patients,Who don't need to be diagnosed. They just need to be bandaged. What causes syncope?,8,15
"Or you're wrong, and he just fell asleep.",How's he gonna sleep with 50 cups of coffee going through his veins?,8,13
Were you nEver a medical resident?,"I hear ten, elEven, and twelve. Where's Thirteen?",6,8
She's not here. And the answer to your next question is no. I don't know,Do you have the answer to my question after that? Space-occupying lesion in his brain is most likely. MRI will prove I'm right.,15,23
Or it'll just prove he suffered head trauma from the crash.,Which we'd wanna find anyway. Two birds with one scan. Do it.,11,12
"That means her blood loss in minimal. Buys us some time. Get the IV into her tibia. It's almost hollow, feeds into the venous system. Which, they obviously don't teach you in EMT school.",Told ya I'd be back.,34,5
Told ya I'd be back.,Heard you might be thirsty.,5,5
I'm gonna be stuck down here for a while. I'd like somebody to talk to.,"Look, the guy who just left is the one who's gonna be holding your hand through all this. You talk to him.",15,22
I gotta call my husband. Can I use your phone?,"Uh, no bars down here. L'chaim.",10,6
Don't worry. Fire marshal Bill will be back soon.,So I hope I didn't weird you out giving you that gift.,9,12
Can we talk about this later?,"Of course. Is now later? Maybe things aren't going so well with Lucas. If so, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to step into anything.",6,24
"Can you help? When I opened it, I didn't think it was a Housewarming gift. I thought it was an engagement present. It just happened last night.",No wonder you wanna hide this from me... Since I'm such a deliCate flower.,27,14
I didn't know what to say. And I've been slightly distracted.,"That might make sense, 'cept you're not wearing the ring. So...You are hiding it, which begs the question",11,18
Please listen to me. You've been down here almost two hours. By the time they clear away the rubble,We are not cutting off her leg. You don't have to rush through this to make his job easier.,19,19
"Dying muscles release poisons. We free your leg, the poisons rush back into your system. It could stop your heart.",So could cheeseburgers. Let's get your lazy friends to start moving that pile. She's got two more hours before crush syndrome could possibly set in.,20,25
"It's not just crush syndrome you gotta worry about, okay? There's gas leaks. There's fire. We can nEver rule out secondary collapses, no matter how much we shore this thing up.","You think chopping off someone's limb inside a pile of dirty rocks is safe? Sepsis, fat embolism, a hemorrhage.",31,19
Just promise me you won't let them cut off my leg.,I promise. Does that make you feel better?,11,8
Your phone is working down here.,Switched carriers. Better rollover minutes. Talk.,6,6
"MRI was clean, but afterwards, he started bleeding out of his eyes and nose.",So there was something wrong before the collapse.,14,8
Unless it's just conjunctive coagulopathy from the trauma.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah  you don't think he was sick before. We get it! You're wrong.",8,16
"The infection causes neurological symptoms, goes systemic, and D.I.C. causes the bleed.",Good theory. Except for the part that there's no fEver. Get an X-ray venogram. See if you can find a reason for your existence. Also look for venous sinus thrombosis.,12,30
Would have seen it on the MRI.,Not if you were too busy not looking for it.,7,10
We should X-ray for a facial fracture first. This could all be simple trauma.,Just do what I tell you. Be back in ten minutes.,14,11
You only came back because I freaked out. Right?,Not at all. I just realized how... big and scary the world is and how cozy and safe this little place is.,9,22
Charlie? I'm here in... They called you? They're helping me. Are you coming? I don't know how this could happen. It's your birthday. I'm so sorry.,"See? This is why I lied about the phone. Your BP is spiking, so you're bleeding faster from your leg wound. I'm gonna have less time to save it. Hang up.",26,31
"Okay. Okay, they're telling me I have to go.",That was stupid of me.,9,5
"He was already on his way. He was in Baltimore, and they all saw it on the news. How Many people were hurt?",What did I tell you about not raising your blood pressure?,23,11
Can I ask what's wrong with your leg?,Crane fell on it. Small world.,8,6
You could have just said no.,I'll remember that for my next huMan contact.,6,8
Would you pray with me?,No. I'm not in the habit of encouraging my Patients' superstitions.,5,11
How is that a habit? You plan on getting trapped under a building again?,I don't beliEve in God.,14,5
"I always thought... If I did the right thing, if I treated people right, then good things would happen to me. You think that's how it works?",I didn't use to. Then recently I tried... Now I don't know.,27,12
You think we can be friends when I get outta here?,Yeah. We'll catch a ball game or... group sex show or something.,11,12
Put the cribbing in there.,"Okay, now when the beam starts lifting, you're gonna feel pain. It's gonna be like your foot's gone to sleep times a billion. You'll notice that I'm waiting till now to tell you.",5,33
I'm feeling the pain already.,That's good. That means the pressure's coming off. Much closer to getting out of here.,5,15
Hey. You better get back up top and make sure you didn't nick an artery.,I'm gonna have to go.,15,5
You're lucky this isn't worse.,You know who's Even luckier? You and just about Every other huMan being who wasn't down there.,5,17
You know who's Even luckier? You and just about Every other huMan being who wasn't down there.,What did the venogram say?,17,5
He didn't say his neck was sore.,That's 'cause Everything's sore. He just took a 15-story swan dive into concrete. Do an LP.,7,16
We also have to consider other infections.,So you're suggesting we do an LP.,7,7
It's been four hours already. It used to be a long shot. Now it's...crazy.,Crush syndrome is basically a buildup of potassium. If we remove potassium,14,12
We're already treating with sodium bicarbonate.,But not with glucose and Insulin. We have glucose in the kit. There's gotta be a diabetic here somewhere.,6,19
You wanna dose the insulin here in a non-hospital setting? That is insane! It's not worth it.,"Really? 'Cause I think I'm the only one here who knows what a leg is worth. And fortunately, you're not the one in charge  he is. And he knows that I'd testify against him if Hanna sues for cutting off a leg without exhausting Every option.",17,47
"I know you're angry, but please don't put her life at risk just to get back at me.",Really? Wow. So this is all about you now.,18,9
You took her side against me right after you heard about my engagement.,Yeah. That must be it. It's not that you're a pathetic narcissist.,13,12
I don't love you. So just... accept it and move on with your life instead of making Everyone miserable.,That's great. A life lesson from a middle-age single mom who's dating a Man-Parkld.,19,14
Screw you. I'm sick of making excuses for you. I'm sick of other people having to tiptoe around you and make their own lives worse while they try to keep you from collapsing. I'm done.,Fantastic. Just stay away from my Patient.,35,7
No. You said... that there was time.,There was. And it's run out.,7,6
How bad will it hurt?,Like nothing you've Ever felt before.,5,6
I don't know. Ten minutes. He was being questioned when he fell into the coma.,Was anything else making him nervous or worried before his other symptoms?,15,12
But that didn't cause his first symptom.,"Yeah, it did. All the caffeine. We thought the pRoblem was in his toilet  by that, of course, I mean his head. Which distracted us from the fact that it could have been just a clog in his sewer pipe, and by that, of course, I mean his spinal cord. And blah, blah, blah, blah. You get the idea.",7,60
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.,"Breath sounds bilaterally. It's not another pneumothorax. Neck vein's flat. There's no tamponade. Damn it, I went in too high. Hanna, you've got a clot in your lung. I'm gonna fix this. IV streptokinase.",6,34
What's happening. What's going on?,Her body won't get any oxygen unless we can bust the clot. This is a blood thinner.,5,17
Is she gonna be all right?,It's gonna make her bleed more. We'll take care of that next.,6,12
It's gonna make her bleed more. We'll take care of that next.,It's not busting the clot.,12,5
You can't blame yourself for her death. This wasn't your fault.,That's the point! I did Everything right. She died anyway. Why the hell do you think that would make me feel any better?,11,23
You shouldn't be alone right now. You're bleeding.,I'm gonna give you a task as an employee. Get out of my way.,8,14
No. It's your choice if you want to go back on drugs.,"Okay. Just so you know, I'm finding it hard to see the downside.",12,13
You need to re-bandage your shoulder.,Is that why you're here? Foreman sent you?,6,8
"I'm stuck, House. I keep wanting to move forward. I keep wanting to move on, and I can't. I mean, my new House, with my new fianc, and all I can think about is you. I just need to know if you and I can work.",You think I can fix myself?,46,6
I know. I love you. I wish I didn't. But I can't help it.,How do I know I'm not hallucinating?,14,7
She loves her brother. She's thinking selflessly. How is that at all,Being moronic? Mm. If I can only think of a harm-free medical treatment she turned down lately.,12,17
"Miss Tanner. Miss Tanner. Oh, dear God.","Which of these says ""I want to sleep with you"" more? Penguin or beaver? Beaver, beaver, beaver. You're right, it's too high school.",7,23
"House, you're stealing from a Woman in a coma.",We're fine. NEver seen her happier.,9,6
I was going to say normal.,"For now. We're in the Honeymoon period. Our brains are flooded with endorphins. Once she snaps out of it, where does that leave us?",6,24
"House, you don't actually think she'd dump you because you, what, don't do yoga? Listen to the B-52s?","Not right away. We'll fight, makeup sex, fight, maybe sex, and then she'll dump me. With possible goodbye sex.",18,19
"So, instead of enjoying the Honeymoon phase, you've decided to skip it entirely.",I need to find something that we both like doing besides each other.,13,13
Right. Or you could just talk to her about it.,"No, then she'll start pretending to like things that she really doesn't just to make me feel better, which will make her feel Even worse, which won't be my fault, so I'll resent her, and that won't be her fault, so she'll resent me. At least with my plan I get my one a day with iron till the bitter end. Is there a reason why you're following me?",10,69
There's nothing wrong with me. My maid just overreacted.,Great. This won't take long then.,9,6
Really? My fans tend to be overly-annoying teenaged girls.,"I know. All they care about is who's hotter, Jack or Deacon. Like Sarah can't love both of them. I may belong to one or two online fan clubs. How's the new book coming along?",9,35
I don't talk about my work.,'Kay. How about nodding your head to a few yesno questions?,6,11
"Anything. Who was Jack's real father, who kidnapped his Uncle...","Deal. I will have to go with, why'd you try to kill yourself? Burn on the side of your face is caused by gunpowder, so, change your mind at the last second, or you just a lousy shot?",10,38
You called us back to work because a lady might have had a seizure.,A seizure while trying to commit suicide.,14,7
So send her for a psych eval. What's that got to do with us?,What is the matter with you people? We're talking about a huMan being who's suffering.,14,15
What is the matter with you people? We're talking about a huMan being who's suffering.,"You're right. That's not enough. She is also the writer of Jack Cannon: Boy Detective, beloved by millions around the world.",15,21
By girls between 10 and 14.,"Look, the point is if she kills herself, millions of fans of all ages and genders will be very disappointed.",6,20
So we're taking this case 'cause you're a fan?,"No, that would be crazy and unprofessional. You're taking this case 'cause I said so. You and Taub do a full workup. Observe her overnight. See if she has another seizure. You can go.",9,34
Why does he get the night off?,"Because he brought a ""smokin'"" hot babe.",7,7
I have plans with my wife.,"Yeah, nice try, but you hate your personal life. And you obviously don't have one.",6,15
"Yeah, nice try, but you hate your personal life. And you obviously don't have one.","Hey. I'd stay myself, but I just bought the flowers.",15,10
"Hey. I'd stay myself, but I just bought the flowers.","Reservation for Dominica's isn't till 8:00, so we got plenty of time.",10,12
We need to pick something up from a haunted House?,This is a Gothic Revival masterpiece. I hope one day to live in a House like this.,10,17
Alice Tanner. Why does that name sound familiar?,I gave you a couple of her books a few years ago.,8,12
Did you steal her keys?,"Think I'd take the Dean of Medicine on a ""B"" and ""E""",5,12
How did you get in here?,"Well, I guess you have your answer.",6,7
"House, Christina has agreed to not call the police.",She's pRobably illegal. Same reason she didn't report the suicide attempt.,9,11
"I call 911. But when Miss Tanner woke up, she say she will fire me if I say anything about the gun.","And if she whacks herself, what happens to your job?",22,10
"I think she's a very depressed person. NEver goes out, doesn't have friends. She has all this money, but all she does is write.",I need to see her latest Manuscript.,24,7
Yes. Her back and her hands hurt a lot.,A writer with back and hand pain. That's very helpful. Let's go.,9,12
"Before there were hard drives, there were...",How Many of these does she eat a day?,7,9
You. What do you want?,You wet the bed. Just not sure how yet.,5,9
She only asked for a Woman to waste time. She's cooperating just enough to get through the psych hold.,Put some lipstick on Chase and start chelation therapy. Confirm with another urine test. Okay. I'll go talk to Cuddy. Maybe she'll let us borrow a dress too.,19,28
This would be me ignoring you. What if we got arrested last night? And whatEver happened to keeping our professional and personal lives separate?,I'm not the one talking about our relationship at work.,24,10
What room should I return it to?,243. I need some help with Alice Tanner. She wants a vagina.,7,12
You'll hire a Woman doctor?,You think we just sit around talking sports and belParkng and farting when the Parkcks aren't around? By when?,5,19
Yeah. Stop. It can't be done.,People wonder why you've nEver cured cancer.,6,7
Did you get this before or after your date with Cuddy?,"Eh, pRobably would have been a wiser choice.",11,8
She's a writer and a recluse. I'd be more surprised if she didn't,What was she doing when it happened?,13,7
Comparing Taub to her ex-husband. She really hated the guy.,Her first symptom was when she had a gun to her head. Excess adrenaline could explain seizures and skyrocketing BP.,10,20
"It's not our fault. She signed the consent forms, denied there was any metal...",Normally I'd say it. Maybe this way it'll finally sink in.,14,11
Normally I'd say it. Maybe this way it'll finally sink in.,She wants to die. You cannot trust anything she says.,11,10
"Longer, if she doesn't stop lying to us. Or we could figure out a way to find it in the 39 hours left on her psych hold.",We need to make her cooperate. We have to offer her something she wants.,27,14
She wants to kill herself House.,I can work with that.,6,5
I can work with that.,I want you to write more books.,5,7
"I'm done writing Jack Cannon's adventures. And when I get out of here, I'll just be done.","Now don't you say that, you dirty birdie. You know, there are easier ways to go than shooting yourself in the head or tearing apart a limb. And this is one of them. The best part, you'll feel so good, you won't Even notice you're dead.",17,46
You expect me to beliEve you're going to help me kill myself?,You're the perceptive one. You tell me.,12,7
Why do you care about me? You think you know me because you read my books?,"No. I know pain. You think you can handle it, and one day you can't. When that happens, you either find reasons to go on, or you don't.",16,28
I'm... I'm all out of reasons.,"Now. When you're pain free, you're gonna want to live and start writing again. And if I'm wrong, got a backup plan to take home with you.",6,27
You're also an excellent liar.,"Wasn't lying about the cure. If we find and remove that pesky, adrenaline-secreting tumor, you'll get better.",5,17
You better hurry. My Lawyer will have me out of here this time tomorrow.,"Yeah, about that, it seems that last night you found and self-administered what you thought was a potentially lethal narcotic. Your psych hold has been extended an additional 24 hours. I know. Bummer, right?",14,34
You think you can get her to try to kill herself again? We're gonna need more time.,There might be a way to get her symptoms without asking her. If writers write what they know.,17,18
I thought you said it was about a boy Detective.,"And his mentor, Aunt Helen, who happens to be around the same age as Alice. Answers could be in the book.",10,21
Great. You finish reading your typewriter ribbon yet?,Look for the tumor with the ultrasound.,8,7
I drove across town to treat a ribbon?,That's why I prefer lying. It makes things easier.,8,9
He told me it was a matter of life and death.,It is. Patient wants to kill herself.,11,7
So do you think Jack finally hooks up with Sarah in this one?,No. Debbie Wright is his true love.,13,7
Wilson just told me we're going on a double date with him and Sam tonight.,You don't like double dates?,15,5
"Well, as your girlfriend, I'm impressed. As your boss, you're a jackass. Don't do it again.","As your boyfriend, I thank you. As your employee, I resent you, because I need this for my case.",16,19
I don't care. Just pick something we'd both enjoy.,Yeah? And what would that be exactly?,9,7
That's... not an answer. It's treatable. We'll start testing to see which drugs she best responds to.,We're not gonna be able to take her pain away. She's still gonna kill herself as soon as she gets released tomorrow. I can't let Jack Cannon end this way.,17,30
"Wilson, party of four. You guys are up next.",Your mom said you loved go-carts.,9,6
Seatbelt nearly broke my neck. I'm done for the night.,It's not my fault Wilson's attracted to psychos.,10,8
You got me. I'll be going back to sleep now.,You damaged your thyroid gland in the crash when the shoulder strap cut into your neck. You don't have lupus. What you have is curable.,10,25
Helen Rutherford kills herself because she feels useless and doesn't want to be a burden.,"Just like you do now. You have hypothyroidism. That's why you feel so tired and worn out. With medication, you'll feel 20 years younger. Or whatEver age you were the last time you didn't want to kill yourself.",15,38
You think you know what Jack deserves?,I know that he deserves better than what you gave him.,7,11
What did you do to me? I can't move. I can't move anything.,How can I be right and wrong? I deduced the car accident because thyroid fit the symptoms. But a damaged thyroid wouldn't explain the paralysis. How can I be wrong about the thyroid but right about the accident?,13,38
We're dead on our feet. I've barely slept in four days.,Aw... that's sad. You know what's Even sadder? Thirteen was the only Man on my team.,11,16
"Yeah, it'd be nice if you hurry up and hire someone to fill her spot.",Do it. Cuddy wants it to be a girl.,15,9
There are a couple of people,I was talking to Chase. I was just looking at you to screw with you.,6,15
We can't find her old medical records.,You woke me up for that?,7,6
I know. Alice is refusing surgery.,She'll be dead in a few days without it.,6,9
Which is why I've spent the last four hours trying to find a legal way to do it without her permission. Unsuccessfully. I'm sorry.,"As your boyfriend, I'm grateful for the effort. As your employee, I'm disappointed at your ineffectiveness.",24,16
"As your boyfriend, I'm grateful for the effort. As your employee, I'm disappointed at your ineffectiveness.",Why would she not tell us about the pins in her leg?,16,12
'Cause she wants to die.,"By having her leg ripped off? She wants to punish herself... for something that happened before she was famous, before she Even started to write. I think the answer's in her old medical records. But dopey, sleazy, and uptighty can't find them.",5,42
Maybe Alice Tanner's just her pen name.,Your boyfriend is an idiot.,7,5
"I'll contact the National Records ArParkve and run the type of screws in her leg against blood type, age, and anything else I think of.",Her first name could be Helen.,25,6
Because I'm a good writer.,"He's cool, but he's awkward. He's brilliant. He makes mistakes. He's funny, but sometimes he takes it too far. Sounds like a great kid.",5,24
Please. Just leave me alone.,"You weren't alone in the car crash. Your son was with you, Helen.",5,13
"You weren't alone in the car crash. Your son was with you, Helen.",The books are your way of keeping him alive.,13,9
Why can't you just let me die in peace?,You haven't been at peace since it happened.,9,8
He could always get me to do what he wanted. He's always been my muse.,"Well, that may be true, but I've been reviewing your muse's autopsy results. It wasn't the crash that killed him. Your son had a brain aneurism. That's why he crashed. He was dead before the impact. There was nothing you could do to save him.",15,45
They would have told me.,"They had no reason to dig any deeper. It was a car accident. I did. It's easy to miss. But you can see the blood buildup here. Your son would have died that day, on a bus, in school, sitting on his bed. The only thing the crash is killing is you. We need to repair that syrinx in your neck.",5,61
Her son didn't have a brain aneurism.,Nope. She shouldn't have let him drive in the rain. Jack was nEver very coordinated.,7,15
"As your boss, I am opposed to you lying to a Patient. As your girlfriend, I'm glad you care.",I don't. I just wanted to save Jack Cannon.,19,9
"Well, I can see why you like him. I started reading one of the books you gave me.",I find that very hard to beliEve.,18,7
Why? Because I can't like something you like? We couldn't possibly,Because I lied about giving you the books.,11,8
"I'm not gonna dump you because we like different food or books or music. On the other hand, I might dump you if you don't talk to me when you have a pRoblem with our relationship.",I know you beliEve that now... But the fact is,36,10
I'd like to thank you.,Great. You can dediCate the next Jack Cannon to me.,5,10
I want to write books for adults.,What about Jack? Your last book didn't answer anything.,7,9
The way I ended Jack's story is perfect. Each reader can decide what fate they want for him themselves.,You  but that's stupid! That doesn't make any sense!,19,10
How Many answers do you get in real life?,"This is a book. Books have beginnings, middles, and ends. You can't just leave it on a cliffhanger  who does that?",9,22
I'm sorry. His story's done. There's really nothing you can say to change my mind.,Your son... Was very lucky to have you as his mother.,15,11
"No, none of us were thinking that.","Well, you should have. But you'd be foolishly wrong. Yes, he's been dating at a near-Clooney pace recently, but at this point, the only hole he's trying to fill is the one in his soul, which means it's the emotional connection with Cameron that he misses. Did you Ever marry a dying Man? And if so, did you freeze his sperm?",7,61
Could be lead poi ,"Uh, uh, uh! If I know Dr. Shameron  and I think I do  she'll want this chance for a little stuff-strutting.",5,23
"At the risk of having Foreman snark at me too, lead poisoning could also work.",Liver angiogram to check for fibrosis. Search the home for heavy metals. What's your position on the legality of illegal break-ins?,15,21
She was nervous. Give her a break. Oh! And she's not like Cameron.,True. Cameron had much smaller breasts. By which I mean she was smarter.,13,13
How are things going with Cuddy?,"Great. We've gotten to fifth base. That's two home runs, and then she gives me back a triple.",6,18
I could see you on this one.,Am I wearing a dashiki? Easy Rider auditions ended four decades ago.,7,12
Are you sleeping over there yet?,"Nope. She comes over, we hook up, she leaves.",6,9
"Okay, taking it slow. That could work. You are spending time with the kid?",As little as possible. That is one boring Parkld.,14,9
"Oh, you think you were the scintillating wit at two and a half?",I wasn't trying to eat shoes. Cuddy could have adopted a golden retriEver.,13,13
"Oh, yeah, things are definitely going great.",We'll get to it when we get to it.,7,9
"You really like these, or are you just avoiding a touchy conversation?",Nah. This one's too metrosexual. This one's too heterosexual.,12,9
Then why did you invite me?,Who'd drive my car home if I buy a bike?,6,10
The operation was done at the University Hospital. Hopefully they still have the records.,Come back. Just one more time. You'll love it.,14,9
"You understand, right? The babysitter's leaving in half an hour.","Oops, you're right. Scram. I've got a massage coming by in five.",10,12
Get the pacemaker. We can overdrive her.,"Dorothy. Dorothy. Dorothy, dear! It's Aunt Em, darling.",7,8
"This is why I didn't tell you. 'Cause you go confront him, he'll kill you.","Well, I've got another name you can tell us instead. Yours.",15,11
Why not just place a chair above a trap door with a shark tank underneath?,Wednesday is when I get my shark tank cleaned. Also because! I'm giving her a chance.,15,16
You're giving her a test.,This whole job is a test. I'm giving her the chance to fail it sooner rather than later. Or pass. Arrhythmia and elevated LFTs rule out hepatic fibrosis. So heart and stomach.,5,32
"You got a better answer than she does, then let's hear it.","I'm sure she's already starting to think how, if we put the symptoms together with the abusive ex, the fact that she'd just eaten, the open door! Rhymes with moison!",12,30
"You think her ex-husband tried to poison her? Even if he found her somehow, these abusers have a pattern. He beat her with his hands. Poison's too impersonal. It doesn't fit.",Exactly. The counterargument is woof!,31,5
She said he used pesticides. He could have stuck some in her dinner.,"Treat with pralidoxime. ""A"" for effort?",13,6
Hey! so I'm seeing you tonight,Yes. And you would have Even it you hadn't told me that.,6,12
"I'm sure I'm imagining this, although I'm not as sure now that I know her name, but she seems a little! how do I say this? I don't know. Um, a bit slutty.","She is a hooker. If she's not slutty, she's doing something wrong.",33,12
What? Did you have sex with her?,"Yesterday? Ah, you're getting confused by the hooker thing. No, of course not. I'm dating you.",7,16
But you used to have sex with her.,"Well, it was a massage plus happy ending sort of thing. Now it's more of a sad ending. Because of you! I've tried 15 different massage therapists over the last few years. I don't know why, but she's the best I've found. She makes my leg feel better.",8,48
So you really think that I would be okay with you getting a massage from a hooker you used to have sex with?,"You don't mind the massage part, you mind the sex part, which doesn't exist anymore.",23,15
I know a great physical therapist. I will give you her number.,Why would I give up one who definitely works for one who might work?,12,14
Because I asked you to.,"That's not really an argument, now, is it?",5,8
"Oh, no, uh, I'm not. You might want to check out volume two on infectious diseases. Patient's husband just got admitted to the E.R.",Let's say you had a really fantastic handyMan!,24,8
I was hoping you'd interrupt my cooking to ask about handymen. Do go on.,Would Sam ask you to stop using him because you might have had a sexual relationship with him in the past?,14,21
"Ah, yes, the age-old hooker massage conundrum. Cuddy might have mentioned something about it. Let's say you're right. Completely right about Everything. Give in anyway.",This is not a point of pride. This is a point of principle.,25,13
"Right, you're the Rosa Parks of hooker massages.","The principle is she's being irrational. If I give in on this, it sets the stage for the whole relationship.",8,20
"Putting up with irrationality is the foundation for Every relationship. I agree with Sam when she's calling her father a monster. I agree with her when she's calling him a saint. And in exchange, I get to have sex with her. And I'm sure she has similar tradeoffs with me. Relationships are hard. You have to make sacrifices. So sacrifice being crazy. Go get her a gift and apologize.",You finally made a good point.,69,6
I already did. No vegetations. Valves are clear.,"Snapilicious! But as I always like to say, it's better to be a helpful Helen than a negative Nelly. So while you're cooking up some ideas of your own, allow me to present theory 2.0 of why Chase hired you. Dr. Kelly, meet your doppelganger. Oh, no. Hold on a second.",8,51
Is that!? That's baby Chase and his mama! That's adorable!,"NEver mind the baby, peep the babe. Note the cheekbones and eye shape.",10,13
They do actually look alike.,"I know what you're thinking, Chase wants to sleep with his mom. But who wouldn't hit that if that looked like that? It's a classic case of what Freud called",5,30
All we know is we don't see it. Dehydration from the fEver could hide the pneumonia.,"Okay, forget the mom theory. Go water the Patient, treat for Legionnaire's.",16,12
Seriously? A massage from a male hooker?,He was? Huh. That doesn't bother me at all. I guess we both learned a valuable lesson.,7,17
"Except that I didn't used to have sex with him, you idiot! Plus, he was a gay hooker.","Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a straight male hooker? Oh, come on. It's a massage. I don't care who gives it to you. Why not treat me the same way?",18,36
I'm sure that some part of you beliEves this idiocy. But you can't possibly be stupid enough to think that you can convince any part of me. And that can only mean you're trying to sabotage this relationship.,Why would I do that? We're doing fine.,38,8
I have been completely open with you.,You won't let me sleep over. You basically haven't introduced me to your daughter.,7,14
But do you want to spend time with her?,"Honestly! before this, I'd have said no. But! yeah. How are we Ever gonna be a couple if you keep hiding her from me?",9,24
"House! I need to protect her. I let you into her life, and you go away!",Call it what it is. I'm not the only one who's holding back.,16,13
"But her delusions are consistent with mental illness. Bipolar disease, for example. She's 30. It could he hitting her right now for the first time.","So her mind just happens to fall apart right after her body? Wow, I thought I was having a bad week.",25,21
I know it sounds coincidental!,"You know what, I'm back to the Cameron theory. That you hired the dumb version of Cameron so that you could fire her and get rEvenge.",5,26
"I realized if we all just keep pressuring Kelly, of course she's gonna get stuff wrong. It's irresponsible of me to let that happen.",You are a true leader of men. Get someone to cut into her head and get me a biopsy.,24,19
I didn't want her to freeze.,"So you titrated the blanket. As her fEver dropped, you lowered the power.",6,13
Not since she was admitted.,Two down. Shooting for three.,5,5
You're gonna turn her pacemaker off? You sure that's a good idea?,"Nope. But it might be. No tachycardia, there's only the delusions left. If they're Even still there.",12,17
But it could have been prompted by the physical symptoms.,You couldn't be more wrong. You've got the cause and effect backwards. Start her on haloperidol and Lorazepam. Give it a few hours to take effect. Call me when she wakes.,10,31
"The table, it's on fire.","If it was, think I'd be able to do this! without screaming for my mommy?",5,15
Her doctor's not in Trenton.,"Not the one you know about. If you haven't figured it out by now, your wife has a secret.",5,19
What the hell is he talking about? Is it about your ex?,"The ex was not so much a secret, more of a lie.",12,12
What the hell am I supposed to do now?,Nothing. Her physical symptoms are gone. We'll put her on a different anti-psychotic for the mental ones. You can take a nap.,9,22
This is not who I married.,Of course she is. You just didn't know it.,6,9
I don't know if I can stay with her.,"Sorry, as your marriage counselor, I'm not allowed to talk to you without your wife present.",9,16
Just-just tell me how hard it would be for us to handle this. Medically.,"Look, if you want me to give you a reason to leave her, fine. Apparently you haven't noticed, but she's got a serious mental illness.",14,25
What? You like her now?,"Nope. But she got me to the right answer, which none of the rest of you did. If you want to give her another shot, go for it.",5,28
You want some more meat?,"This is meat? Yes, please.",5,5
"This is meat? Yes, please.","Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, kid. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Hey, hey, hey.",5,18
What's happening? What's wrong with my baby? Why doesn't someone talk to me?!,"Cancel your dinner plans. Short on medical history. She's only eight hours old. What she's not short on is doctors. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to solve her breathing pRoblems.",13,32
I need you a minute.,Silent reading time till I get back.,5,7
My mother can't come. She has a cooking class.,"Oh, you've really got a pRoblem.",9,6
If only there were... some mature adult in my life who could pinch hit in emergencies like this.,"Love to, but I'm catParkng up on my back issues of Nudist Circus. You should see what the fat lady's got under her big top.",18,25
All I need is a warm body. She'll be asleep the entire time.,I got a sick baby here who needs me. Yours is healthy.,13,12
You could deal with your team by phone.,How about a little something extra when you get home?,8,10
Sex! I still don't see a female doctor in that room. It's making me very unhappy.,"Fine. Out of the goodness of my heart, which will make you happy, which will make you desire me more, which will turn into more sex.",16,26
The sperm donor card from the father did note a history of asthma.,What if her lung pRoblems are not coming from her lungs?,13,11
Her liver enzymes are elevated.,"When the liver fails, it stops producing proteins. Specifically the ones that keep your plasma inside your blood vessels and outside your lungs. Fix the liver, she'll have enough breath to keep the entire ward up all night. Foreman... you need to stay after school. I apparently need to apologize. Last week, I should not have gone over your head and allowed Chase to hire a new team member. So go hire someone who liked The Bridges of Madison County.",5,80
Do you want me to hire a white girl?,"Go find a Woman, and wipe that self-satisfied grin off your face.",9,12
This'll be quick. I've been interviewing people all week. I have it narrowed down to two candidates.,"Well, narrow it down to one before Cuddy starts withholding sex.",17,11
"Uh, she hasn't said anything to me about that.","I said, wipe the grin.",9,5
No. Go back to bed. I said bed!,Wilson! Hey. You up for a boys' night in?,8,9
"House, there's someone here I need you to meet. I just hired Dr. Christina Fraser. She's a board certified",Nice to meet you. You're fired.,19,6
"You are such an ass, House. You could have made the same point without crushing the hopes of a young doctor who was actually excited to have this job.","No, I'm not sure I could have. I think you give me far too much credit. Taub... it's your turn to find a young doctor who's actually excited to have this job.",29,32
You told me you gave them your credit card...,And you were dumb enough to beliEve me. Cuddy'll be back in an hour and ten minutes... I'll be back in an hour and five.,9,25
You're not gonna leave the kid?,"Yes, I am. 'Cause unlike you, I don't have a conscience.",6,11
You're not gonna leave a two-year-old unattended.,Sure. I'm leaving her with you. A responsible adult.,7,9
Better get back in there. Kid's all alone.,"It's kind of bugging you, isn't it?",8,7
"Objectively, since I nEver accepted this responsibility, it kind of isn't.","True, and yet it is. Because you're you.",11,8
"Fine. You're right. You know what I can do? I can go in there and call a babysitting service for 15 bucks an hour, then call Cuddy and tell her who's watParkng her kid and why.",I'll stay if you stay.,36,5
...We were gone two minutes.,"What have you got there, sweetie?",5,6
"What have you got there, sweetie?","Come on now, spit it out.",6,6
"Okay... you ordered the moo shoo pork... and the orange cashew Parkcken, right?",Like I always order. Did you clean up in there?,13,10
Like I always order. Did you clean up in there?,"Well, he could have shortchanged you. Fridge magnet's not getting anything.",10,11
"That's because it's a fridge magnet! Unless she swallowed a Canadian dime, it's not magnetic.","Really? I mean, kids swallow things all the time, right? I mean, she swallowed a dime, she poops it out. She'll be fine.",15,23
"If you don't tell Cuddy, I will go out there and tell her myself!",Yeah? What are you gonna tell her? Are you gonna tell her that... you left coins out? And you left her Parkld unsupervised?!,14,23
That's not like her... is she all right?,She's fine. How about I stay the night? Then you can really thank me.,8,14
You want me to reset the alarm?,"God, no. Case is under control. I'm sleeping in.",7,9
"Hey, Marina! Pasta's in the fridge","I assume, since you're calling so early, that the surgery was a rousing success.",6,14
"And I assume, since you still think we actually did the surgery, you haven't checked your messages in eight hours. Where are you?","I beliEve this is what your people term a ""poopy call"".",23,11
"Uh, the word is ""booty"".","Well, I don't know what you're doing, but this is a poopy call.",5,13
It's not Caroli's syndrome. Dr. Cheng spotted a,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?! I know about the Jew, the black, and the croc-hunter, but when did we get our Asian persuasion on?",8,24
Dr. Cheng... is the NICU attending on the case. And she's not here.,"Well, then I just wasted a perfectly good racial epithet.",13,10
She spotted a vascular malformation in the baby's liver.,Good call... Except for Everything you just said. There's no way that our Patient has a vascular malformation.,9,18
And you can tell that from the vast amount of information you've gleaned from not being here?,Don't need to be there to remember that the Patient's A.L.T.s were three times normal. The baby's liver damage is far too extensive. Dr. Cheng's an idiot.,17,27
"In fairness, it wasn't completely her idea. More of a Foreman kinda thing.","Well, then you're an Even bigger idiot for trying to cover for her.",13,13
"House, we treated for a vascular malformation, and she got better!","No, she didn't. Call me when she crashes again.",11,9
"All right, she's in her office. Move fast.","You see a double-wide tuchus coming this way, you scream like a girl.",8,13
"If Rachel wakes up, she's gonna tell Cuddy Everything.","She's two! Last night, she was whining about the giant moose that lives outside her window.",9,16
She's crashing again. Where are you?,Is it actually important that I understand what you say?,6,10
Just past the ileocecal valve.,It's nothing. It's just an irregularity.,5,6
"Yeah, with FDR's face on it.",That's not a face. It's a shadow.,6,7
"House, the thing is perfectly round.","Well, move the wand to the side.",6,7
"Gonna tickle you Even more! Look at""look at that.",We need an X-ray to be sure.,9,7
I saw your extension on the call. What are you doing down here?,"Uh, Wilson's got a two-year-old with cancer. She's in a lot of pain. It's very sad.",13,16
"Uh, Wilson's got a two-year-old with cancer. She's in a lot of pain. It's very sad.",He also has an outstanding bedside Manner.,16,7
...Her liver failure is getting worse. You were right. Now what?,"The interesting question is not why she's worse now, but why she got better in the first place.",11,18
Could have been something we did that temporarily reliEved the,What'd you put her on again?,10,6
"After the transfusion, we gave her steroids, dopamine, and the anti  steroids can treat idiopathic hepatic fibrosis. It would explain why she got better and then worse.",But not the multiple dilated ducts.,28,6
"House, I need you back in here!","Cancer kid trumps liver kid. Sorry. Confidentiality. There are rules, you know.",7,12
Sounds to me like someone's going to get some yummy chocolate.,You're gonna make a great mommy one day. Thanks for waiting. Hook the mom up to the baby. Direct blood transfusion.,11,21
I thought her expertise could,Could tell us the O2-stats. I hope you come with some original ideas.,5,13
"Either the mom's blood is special, which would mean it's treating something specific, which means the baby has a disease... Or mom's blood is just blood, and it's replacing something the baby is missing, which means the baby has a simple deficiency.","Given the liver failure, a deficiency of clotting factors, enzymes, or vitamins are the most likely.",42,16
"I'm O Negative, universal donor.","Hook yourself up. Dr. Cheng, hook me up. Walk with me. My team seems to have taken a shine to you.",5,21
That would be a fair assumption.,"Well, I'm gonna have to test you. Let's say, two-year-old... swallowed a coin twenty hours ago. She's gonna be fine, right?",6,21
"Another six hours, max. By then, her system is clear. If it's not out, it's not coming out.","And then what do I do? I mean, what do you do? It's your test.",18,15
I'd go in with a scope and get it. Did I pass?,It's not up to me. Talk to Taub.,12,8
Turns out toilets are handy in this situation. And I felt relatively sure that Cuddy wouldn't come in.,"Oh, Cuddy's been in here.",18,5
Seriously? This must be a terrible place to have s,"Is there such a place? Okay, six more hours, then we're going in with a scope and pulling it out.",10,20
Scope a two-year-old? It's dangerous.,"And as you keep pointing out, so is a dime ripping through her intestines.",5,14
"Cuddy will be home from work in six hours. But no big deal. I'll just scream ""look over there!"" while you quickly shove a scope up her daughter's rectum.","I could offer to baby-sit again, let her have the night out.",29,12
Sure. That won't raise any suspicions.,I wish I was nicer. Hey. Give me your radiation dosimeter.,6,11
PRoblems in radiology. A radiation dosimeter badge turned positive. I could have a CT Scanner that's leaking... a spilled vial of thallium somewhere... I don't Even know whose badge it was. The code was scratched off.,"That had to be intentional. I mean, why would anyone",36,10
I will make it worth your while.,I am not going to bargain babysitting for sex. Who the hell said that? Of course I will.,7,18
I found a mole under the nail on her left index finger. The biopsy rEvealed it's melanoma.,That's it? How come no one got me food?,17,9
"What do you mean, ""that's it""? The Woman has melanoma. She could die if we don't","Boring. Since the baby has the melanoma, we kind of already knew the mom had it.",16,16
"Yes, but now we know where it is, so we can  ...treat it much more effectively, so...","Great. So treat her. Also boring. What's interesting is that mom's melanoma spread to the baby in-utero, which means it's metastatic, which means it's late stage. How Many people with a late stage melanoma are as healthy as she is?",18,40
"If her immune system was fighting the melanoma, it nEver would have spread.","Exactly, which means it's fighting something else, and the melanoma cells are getting caught in the crossfire. So what's mom's immune system really shooting at?",13,25
"Or infections that cause granulomas, TB, mycobacteria.","See, Dr. Cheng? This is not boring. Start with auto-immune. Go test her blood. And leave your food.",7,18
"You brought food? This is a medical procedure, not a dinner date!","I'm aware that this is a deliCate procedure. I'm also aware that my hands are shaking from low blood sugar 'cause I haven't eaten all day. So while this may seem insensitive, this crucial, lifesaving moo shoo  where are my extra pancakes? Damn it, they forgot the extra pancakes for my moo shoo pork. Every time that new girl with the blue streak in her hair answers the phone, they screw up.",12,73
"I'm aware that this is a deliCate procedure. I'm also aware that my hands are shaking from low blood sugar 'cause I haven't eaten all day. So while this may seem insensitive, this crucial, lifesaving moo shoo  where are my extra pancakes? Damn it, they forgot the extra pancakes for my moo shoo pork. Every time that new girl with the blue streak in her hair answers the phone, they screw up.",Was she there when you picked up the food?!,73,9
You ordered extra pancakes?? How much did they cost? Where,55 cents. And there were two.,10,6
...Yeah. So the image that we saw on the ultrasound,"Was obviously just a pocket of air, like I said all along. But you saw the worst case scenario... ...like Every irrational, worried parent. You'd make a terrible mommy.",10,29
"What's that smell? Onions? Peppers? Oh, I know! It's a sausagefest.","Sausagefest implies multiples. Now, if you're talking about yardage, I'd have to agree.",11,13
You've had plenty of time to find someone.,I've found plenty of someones. Just haven't kept them.,8,9
She's a third-year med student. She graduated high school when she was 15. She filled out the time before med school getting PhDs in both applied math and art history.,She'll be incredibly useful if my next Patient is an Escher drawing. Those things are seriously screwed up.,30,18
"Patient is Joe Dugan, 42, political consultant. Presents with palpable purpura, and ALT and AST are through the roof.",Otherwise known as rash and liver damage. Fascinating.,19,8
"Senator Anderson sent this case to us, and personally requested we take a look. That's reason enough for me.",Black guy campaigning for the opposition? Does Obama know about this?,19,11
I tried calling him on the brother hotline. He didn't pick up.,"Martha M. Masters? I'm Dr. House. This is the rest of the team. Boring, Bimbo, and Bite-size. Martha enjoys quadratic equations, Italian frescoes, and her turn-ons include learning to be a doctor. Take a seat.",12,35
Six. It's my favorite constant.,"She's like the Internet with breasts. Oh, no, wait! the Internet has breasts.",5,13
"Our Patient's liver damage explains the rash and cryoglobulins we found in his blood, but we can't explain the liver damage. Shows no other signs of drug or alcohol abuse.","Now all we've gotta do is figure out which one is bimbo and which one is bite-size. Also, which monster truck won the 2004 thunder nationals?",30,26
Test came back negative. Same for Hep A and B.,The answer we were looking for is Virginia Giant. Feel free to Parkme in on either conversation.,10,17
Tetrachloroethylene. Could Even be pennyroyal or sassafras oil.,"Go to his House, get me some chemicals. You wanna stay on this team, have an opinion.",8,17
"A jug of unpasteurized cider. It could be tainted with E coli, and that's what's causing the liver to shut down.",E coli is found in animals. So unless he's drinking pork cider! Pork cider! I need the number of the patent office.,21,22
Masters refused to go on the search with us.,"Interesting. Which raises the question, what is your pRoblem with her?",9,11
He is intimidated by her intelligence.,Why would that bother Taub? He's been working with people smarter than him for a long time. I think perky new girl makes him feel old.,6,26
She's basically the same age as Thirteen.,"Yeah, but she's a student. Makes you contemplate your med school days. Back when you had hair, muscle tone, and no need for a regular prostate exam.",7,27
"Makes sense. Just like E coli. Orchards make cider out of apples they can't sell otherwise, like if they've fallen onto the ground. Like, into some cow feces.","Which would mean our esteemed Patient is literally full of B.S. Cool. Go get the ingenue, start the Patient on aztreonam and plasmapheresis.",28,23
"We think it's a transient ischemic attack. The clot must have broken up before we could find it. He was temporarily paralyzed, but he's regaining mobility and speech.","So, what causes rash, liver failure, clots, and the uncontrollable urge to rat out your coworkers? Oh, no, wait! That last one was you, not the Patient.",28,27
I wasn't trying to rat. I was clearly trying to honor my ethical obligation. Portal vein thrombosis could be caused by Wilson's disease?,"Hooray! You popped your cherry, diagnostically speaking. Unfortunately, the first time always sucks. Pitch doesn't make any sense. Dugan's cornea was normal. You're obviously brilliant. So why would you hide your mind?",23,32
"Not without diminished mental capacity, loss of judgment. Disseminated intravascular coagulation, howEver, fits.","Rules are just helpful guidelines for stupid people who can't make up their own mind. You obviously don't fit into that Category, so why put yourself there?",13,27
"No, his tactics. He's most likely the one who leaked it and all the commentators are saying Anderson will catch a major backlash.",And honesty's a great idea until your Patient asks if her distended abdomen makes her looks fat.,23,17
"House, I hate to interrupt your ethics Debate, but we have two solid ideas on the table.",CT from his neck to his abdomen for neuroendocrine tumors. Run a D-dimer and fibrinogen for D.I.C.,17,17
CT from his neck to his abdomen for neuroendocrine tumors. Run a D-dimer and fibrinogen for D.I.C.,"Masters. If lying to a Patient saved their life, would you do it?",17,13
"So, you lie when it doesn't matter but you won't when it does. How'd you get so screwed up?",How mad would you be if I fired Masters?,19,9
Very. Unless you had cause. Real cause. Cause that a huMan being would consider cause.,"NEver mind, then. She's got principles. She's like the love Parkld of Einstein and Mary Poppins. Didn't Even get Einstein's hair.",15,21
She has a fresh perspective. Unless that threatens you.,"It does not! You thought I'd get defensive, keep her out of pride.",9,13
"It's not just your liver we have to worry about. Looks like your kidneys are having pRoblems, too.",So this guy spends his entire life campaigning against bleeding hearts. And it turns out he has one.,18,18
"Bloody urine actually is a renal pRoblem, not a cardiac one.","Yeah, if I say something inaccurate, assume it's for comic effect. Then laugh,",11,13
"H.S.P. Doesn't usually cause clots, but it can. And the vasculitis would explain the kidney pRoblem.","She can't diagnose a joke, but she's making progress on the Patient.",16,12
"Once again, the bunny meets the blade.","The road to dead Patients is paved with ""or""s. Chemo is the more effective treatment, which means it'll confirm our diagnosis more quickly.",7,23
"I agree, but there is another option.","There are lots of other options. There's bloodletting, crystals, prayer!",7,10
We can't withhold information. If we explain both the benefits and the risks of each treatment I'm sure Dugan will choose chemo.,"Well, as long as you're sure.",22,6
"Doctor, can you talk some sense into him?","Would that I could, but ethics dictate that it's his decision. So all I can do now is return to my office knowing, Even as my Patient endangers himself, my integrity remains unblemished.",8,33
"I was just down by Dugan's room. They were ready to give him the wrong medicine. I tried to change the order, but I'm not a doctor.",Good. The wrong medicine is the right medicine.,27,8
I'm gonna tell him what's going on.,"No, you're not. I don't mind your morality in theory. But in practice, you're risking my Patient's life. So you're fired.",7,21
You think that's gonna stop me from telling him?,"If you do, I'll get you thrown out of medical school.",9,11
"If you do, I'll get you thrown out of medical school.","I know. But unlike you, I'm willing to lie.",11,9
"Firing her was a mistake. We need someone like her on the team, keeping us all in check.",You're incapable of noticing when I do something inappropriate?,18,9
Things have been just fine without Pippi Longdivision.,Your opponent's out of the race. You can drop the smear campaign.,8,12
Masters was right. He didn't want the chemo. He didn't need the chemo.,Masters was wrong. He doesn't have H.S.P. And Masters is gone.,13,11
SParkstosomiasis wouldn't respond to aztreonam.,That's a great idea if he was running a political campaign in Africa. The guy hasn't been out of the country in years.,5,23
"Who needs to travel when you've got a giant fish tank loaded with tropical fish, tropical snails carrying tropical bacteria like sParkstosomiasis?","Well, break into his home, get me some escargots. Unless you wanna ask the Patient's permission as a tribute to the departed.",22,22

"That's great, but the Senator and I have not had sex.","Well, then the two of you shot up together.",11,9

I'm not gonna lie to him.,"You have a math degree. So let's see if you can follow along here. You lie to him, he definitely consents, he might live. You tell him the truth like last time, he might not consent, he definitely dies. Remind me what's so wrong about lying?",6,46
"Well, technically, it works infinitely better because arsenic has a 0 chance. This is your only shot. Both Dr. House and I beliEve that.

I did it. And I didn't have to lie.,And you feel good about that?,9,6

I don't think I can take a risk like that.,"Well, then you shouldn't have let her fire me! Look, all you have to do is switch the I.V.s again.",10,20
"I agree. Fungal endocarditis fits. But we still have to tell your mother. I don't want to tell her, not at all. But the Patient is the highest priority.","I'm kicking you out of your office. Yes, you. This is not her office yet. If you tell anyone, I will get you thrown out of med school, and I will destroy your career.",29,34
I've thought about that. Lying about me! won't work. Everybody knows your reputation.,"True! but I won't have to lie. Buried in your coma Patient's big, big file is a form that doesn't allow treatment without the expressed consent of the relatives.",13,29
You set me up? Why?,Because this Patient is the highest priority.,5,7
"I'm skipping the credentials committee. I'm going straight to the state board and reporting you for  what you've done is so off the spectrum, I don't know there's a specific name for it.",I think he's talking to you.,34,6
"Are you blaming me? This is all because you're so arrogant, you goaded her into firing you!","Actually, my mistakes started a little after that, when I agreed to your brilliant scheme to keep me on the case after she'd fired me off it.",17,27
She would have left the hospital.,"Only 'cause you would have let her, like you did just now.",6,12
You think I can control her?,I don't know. I've nEver seen you try.,6,8
I have been rebelling against this Woman my entire life.,"Here's what I've seen. She insults you, you complain to me. I drug her at dinner, you nEver let her know. We slip her medicine, happens behind her back. You nEver confront her! and it pisses me off.",10,38
Are you taking this personally?,"She leaves, she dies. One day! maybe a week from now, maybe a year from now, you're gonna decide that the Man sleeping next to you killed your mother. Get me my Patient back.",5,34
I feel a little dizzy.,Your heart's still weak from the infection. We'll hang an antifungal I.V.,5,12
That's what he told me.,"Two days ago? I said that I didn't have a department to run, I was being sarcastic.",5,17
That doesn't make any sense. Of course they can. But you weren't.,I love A-Rod. He's soooo modest. And I highly respect the paintings he has of himself as a centaur. Question  do I like A-Rod?,12,25
It can't be. You treated with chelation for lead.,"She got better, then she got worse. She nEver stopped being poisoned.",9,12
Chris! you were a crappy husband! but you are a good person.,"Once again, you are unfired.",12,5
I keep my job if I stand up to you. I keep it if I don't. I! don't buy it.,"When Cuddy was protecting me before, she was protecting a doctor. She's now protecting a boyfriend. The hospital's not gonna put up with that for long. So I need you to protect me from doing something Cuddy will regret. See you bright and late tomorrow.",20,45
I can't move my legs!,"Picture a door. Unlocked with the key of the mind. Two medical cases, both more fascinating than the last.",5,19
That actually makes no logical sense.,"This is not a door to logical sense. Also, shut up. Case number one. 33-year-old Woman named!",6,17
"This is not a door to logical sense. Also, shut up. Case number one. 33-year-old Woman named!","Something I can't remember. You'll see the irony in a second. Presenting with temporary paralysis, high CK lEvels, and a perfect memory.",17,22
So we have two symptoms: Temporary leg paralysis and elevated CK.,Obviously you're not suffering from the same condition 'cause you've already forgotten my dramatic voiceover. There's a third symptom.,11,19
Hyperthymesia is known to Manifest in adolescence.,"Yeah, in the whole five documented cases.",7,7
She's a waitress. They're no strangers to botulism or alcoholism. We should search the diner and where she lives.,"Or you could search her brain. You know, where her memory lives. Save the gas. You two check her home. You two get a complete Patient history. We'll see who gets an answer first.",19,34
I was recovering from the flu. I'm retaking it next week. It's not an issue.,"Normally, I'd let Darwinism run its course. But Cuddy's in a big tizzy about her poster boy getting canned. So, how are we gonna get the short guy off the short bus?",15,32
I don't need a tutor.,"Tutor it is. Choose your poison. Chase, if you prefer pounding Aussie beers and commiserating over the suckiness of divorce. Masters, if you want nervous energy, flash cards, and obnoxious pieces of arcane trivia. Foreman, if you need to be berated by a humorless hard-ass.",5,45
Interesting. You must be more worried than you look.,"I need a consult, Dr. Wilson.",9,6
"Her granddaughter, I think. Early stages of dementia. What's the consult?",I need your medical opinion on what bar we're gonna hit for happy hour tonight to kick off the official end to your three-month pity party over Sam.,11,28
My computer crashed. Lost my database of his acquaintances.,Or you're both lying to me.,9,6
We found a pretty large stash of laxatives. Abuse can lead to hypermagnesemia.,I admit that's! impressively outside-the-box thinking. Hmm.,13,7
"Okay! Uh, so we push fluids and wait for her kidneys to clear the hypermagnesemia?","You'll be waiting a long time since that's not what she has. Her BP and respiratory rate are normal. While you two were so busy being impressively outside the box, you missed the actual box. Chase and Masters done yet?",15,40
It's okay. Remembering something is not the same as understanding it. I'm not a genius. I love my job. I'm great at it. Keeps my mind busy.,"Hi. I'm Dr. House. You are not pooping. Question is, are you also a klutz?",27,15
Uh! I guess I'm no clumsier than most people.,"What are you guessing for? You've got a perfect memory. I was told there'd be numbers, dates, fireworks.",9,18
What do you want to know?,"Let's go back to 2008. How Many trips, stumbles, falls did you have?",6,13
That's a big spike in discoordination.,"If you add the constipation, it's early onset Parkinson's. Give her a full neuro exam, and start her on levodopa.",6,20

"Okay, fine. I got a cat. Release the Kraken.",I don't think you appreciate the sEverity of your situation. You are rapidly approaParkng an end-stage male spinsterism.,9,18
I don't think you appreciate the sEverity of your situation. You are rapidly approaParkng an end-stage male spinsterism.,"That cat, that diabetic cat that you're shooting up with Insulin and buying dime bags of catnip for, that means you've given up on Ever finding anyone.",18,27
Don't you think you're completely overreacting?,"If I'm completely overreacting, why'd you lie to me?",6,9
"Um, because I knew you would completely overreact.","Its name's Sarah. Cats aren't named that, women are. What the Freud is that about?",8,15
"Look, I didn't name her. My neighbor did. She died, and I felt bad. Sarah would have been destroyed at the shelter.","Aww, who would want a cat that croaks if you're not home twice a day to shoot it up? It's like having your own button on Lost. You know, I'm pretty sure that there is a river nearby.",22,38
"We're back to transient paralysis and high CK, plus arrhythmia.","Masters, when you finally blossom into a Woman, would you Ever sleep with a Man who had a cat?",10,19
"Maybe we're missing the obvious. The heart could be behind Everything. If it's not pumping effectively, the muscles shut down, CK elevates, coordination suffers. Why are you asking about cats?",Curiosity. Can we focus here?,30,5
She said they'd been estranged for over six years. That's a lot of tension.,Run a stress test to confirm long QT.,14,8
It'll have to be drug-induced. Treadmill will pull her stitches.,"Drugs are nEver the answer. If we want her heart to go crazy, there's something simpler and safer. Use the sister.",10,21
"No. I said I didn't know anything about Wilson having a friend named Sarah. Under House rules, that is not a lie. He's lonely. That cat is a nice way for him to get some affection.",That's not the kind of putty tat he needs to be getting it from. He needs a putty tat he can tap.,36,22
Why is it so important to you?,"After divorce number two, he fell into a committed relationship with a three-legged Siamese. He stopped answering his phone, redecorated his place like Grey Gardens. He wasn't able to come back to huManity until a window was left suspiciously and heroically open. How that cat opened the window, I will nEver know.",7,52
He just needs more time. Leave him and the cat alone.,I won't if you will.,11,5
Why are you giving me these?,"Because, while they're off running all these tests, you will be submitting the insurance forms.",6,15
There's an entire department for that.,"Exactly. The Foreman department. Of which you are the Foreman, Foreman. I know you got the time. A little Wallaby told me that you recently vaCated your post as Taub's savior.",6,31
He doesn't need a tutor. He needs Ritalin and a babysitter.,"Consider the forms incentive. Taub doesn't pass, he'll become a perManent part of your life.",11,15
"This isn't really about Cuddy, is it? It's about you. You don't want to lose me. I think you care.","Don't think you can disgust me into pulling Foreman off you. Pulse the Patient with steroids for the autoimmune. Start her on dialysis for the kidney failure. Treat the Taub with insults and small slaps for the obstinacy, and start him on studying for the brain failure.",20,47
You planted something in my apartment to make me think I'm allergic to Sarah.,"Paranoia is the first sign of toxoplasma gondii, the parasite linked to crazy cat lady disease.",14,16
I'm not paranoid. I'm allergic to ragweed and dandelion. I'm not allergic to cats. You're trying to gaslight me.,"Maybe your subconscious is afraid that you're gonna die alone. And it just comes out as gibberish and sneezing. Prove that I'm overreacting. Boys' night out. Good Time Charlie's. They just changed their slogan to, ""where the trashiest ladies",19,39
"You do see the hypocrisy in all this, don't you? Until recently, your lifestyle of choice was self-exile.",But I nEver had a cat. Why don't you pick me up at 8:00?,18,14
Could be pulmonary edema from renal failure.,Pulmonary edema doesn't give you hives.,7,6
You think this is an allergic reaction? It can't be. We pumped her full of steroids.,"It can be. If it was a really, really bad one.",16,11
"It can be. If it was a really, really bad one.",I have good news and bad news. The good news is I was right about you having some autoimmune disease. You're just allergic to the dialysis.,11,26
"But if I can't have dialysis and my kidneys are failing, won't that mean I'll die?","Well, you figured out the bad news.",16,7
"That relationship was broken long before we got there. Nadia literally keeps score. She tallies Everything. She decided Elena's done more bad things to her than good, doesn't deserve her affection.","I'm sure she's right. Unlike Everybody else in the world, her memory seems to let her keep a pure and objective view of people in relationships. There's no petty",31,29
'Cause it's making her die alone of kidney failure in room 205?,"Not necessarily. Nadia's sister's not like her. I'm sure she's got plenty of subjective emotions we can exploit. Why don't you go channel your guilt, see if you can get her to cough up a kidney?",12,36
Me? I'm not good at that type of thing. Someone else should go.,Someone else didn't screw this up.,13,6
What are you trying to find out?,"If she's telling the truth. She claims she objectively sees reality. Weighing the good and bad in people. If that's true, I don't care how Many times her sister borrowed her scrunParke without asking, a free kidney ought to trump all the bad stuff.",7,44
"We haven't considered her blood. Clots could hit her leg, heart, kidney, and brain.",Factor 5 leiden. Easiest to treat if we're right. Start her on heparin. And ask for the thank you.,14,19

"Um, I find them calming.",You Ever left one unfinished?,5,5
Why are you doing that?,"More important question is, why are you?",5,7
Each brain with OCD has its own way of filtering it. Some people wash their hands and hoard TV Guides. You do puzzles and hoard memories.,So what we thought was a gift! is just you literally obsessing over your own life.,26,16
"That's why I can't stop the memories, Even when I try. But Everything else? My kidneys?","Memory was just a symptom of a symptom of a larger disease. You have McLeod syndrome. It's a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system, the blood. And can cause! OCD.",16,32

Did you actually wake up early and hide under the bed just to scare the crap outta me?,Set an alarm and Everything.,18,5
It's like dating a ten-year-old.,"God, I hope not. Now that we're down here!",5,9
You really don't have to be here.,You're my girlfriend. I'm being supportive.,7,6
I'm mainly talking about them.,"Well, given that there's almost certainly nothing wrong with you, and my Patient definitely has something wrong with him",5,19

All right. If you could scoot down.,"Hey, I'm, uh, I'm missing a watch. So can you keep your eyes open while",7,15

As demonstrated by my sitting here calmly going about my business.,"Calling a Lawyer, drafting a will! Okay. I-I! hacked into your online schedule. Look, tests always show something. A mass in your kidney could be a complex cyst. It could be benign.",11,32
"I'm a single mom. I need to set up a trust, appoint a guardian. It's silly that I haven't done it before now.",But you're doing it now because you think you're sick. The freaking out can at least wait until after the biopsy this afternoon.,23,23
The biopsy's not till tomorrow. It's the first opening in the schedule.,"For the Dean of Medicine, the first opening in the schedule is! Oh, look! Now.",12,15
Mouth on that kid makes Mel Gibson sound like Nelson Mandela. Where'd she learn that?,"I don't know why you're here, but I didn't do it.",15,11
Are either of you this girl's father?,"Nope. But since her mom died, she's my favorite tax write-off. Officer, you have my word it won't happen again. 'Cause next time! she won't get caught!",7,27
I'm not sure. I think I just peed blood.,Looks like peeing blood is the new black.,9,8
"Kidney mass wouldn't explain the coughing blood or the hemorrhages. Antiphospholipid syndrome, on the other hand!",Makes sense. But doesn't rule out a mass.,16,8
Cuddy has a mass on her kidney?,It's pRobably just a complex cyst or angiomyolipoma.,7,8
And then you pointed out how sweet that was.,"If it were heroin, he'd be going through withdrawal. Antiphospholipid syndrome's a better fit. Start the Patient on plasmapheresis.",9,19
"While he's doing that, can I at least search his House for drugs?",Have I Ever said no to that question?,13,8

You know what's good for that? Practice. Doing it  I don't know  once?,I'm not gonna act like there's a crisis before we know there is one. There's no proof there's anything wrong with her.,15,22
"So what causes bleeding, kidney pRoblems, and unilateral numbness?",And a complete absence of any record of Cuddy's kidney biopsy. She must have put it under a false name so I couldn't rush the results.,9,26
"What if we had it backwards and it's not a bleeding pRoblem, it's a clotting pRoblem?",There's no Patient file created in the last two days for anyone having that procedure.,16,15
"Okay, but in the meantime",Do an angiogram. You two go to pathology and look at Cuddy's slides.,5,13
You just said you didn't know which sample was hers.,I guess you're gonna have to look at them all.,10,10
"I was going to send Chase to tell you what the obvious right thing to do here is, but then I realized! if you were too stupid to know how stupid that was, you might miss the irony. You have to be with her.",Yeah. I get it. She needs artificial support for an artificial pRoblem. She's fine.,44,14

"Fourteen Patients with kidney biopsies. I tabulated them against their urinalysis results. Six men, three diabetics, one LCDD, one kid, two seniors, and by default, one! Cuddy.

"The file says they're doing some imaging now, give the surgeon a better idea of what he's dealing with.",Can we order pizza? There's nothing in the fridge. At least not anymore. What's happening with the Patient?,19,18

You're not. And I'm worried you might do something Even stupider. Why don't you move back in with me? At least until you get back on track.,What an ego. You think you're some sort of emotional paragon? You're my rock?,27,14
I'm trying to be a friend.,At least I have the good sense not to marry Every Woman I fall into bed with. Maybe you should move in with me.,6,24
Either way. If you prefer!,I prefer you to stop talking about this.,5,8
"No. We are gonna talk about this, and we're gonna deal with this.","So I have no choice? Fine. Unless! unless! Yes, I do. I do have legs. I see you didn't factor those into your brilliant plan.",13,25
You can't go backwards. I can't fix his pRoblem. I am his pRoblem.,"If the infection's not in his heart, then it's in his brain. You're in my sun. Do a CT.",13,19
We can't. He has a titanium plate and a bunch of metal screws.,So get rid of them.,13,5
His skull has multiple hairline fractures. Removing the metal plate will be like removing half an eggshell without cracking the rest of the shell.,And not removing the plate will be like leaving the egg out to rot.,24,14
We can't cut off the top of his head based on a few symptoms that disappear whenEver we try to test for them.,"What if the one symptom that hasn't disappeared was nEver actually there? Any delays when he answers questions? He doesn't have partial hearing loss. He's missing moments. He reported having something like a complex partial seizure during a bull ride. Said it hasn't happened since, but what if he's wrong? What if the infection in the brain is causing it to happen all the time?",23,65
His E.E.G. didn't show any sign of seizure activity.,I didn't say it was a seizure. I said it was something like a seizure.,9,15
And I'm guessing you're about to tell us we need to find something like an E.E.G. to prove!,"Nope, 'cause I already got one.",18,6
You want me to sing? How's singing My Bonnie gonna help you see inside my brain?,"It won't. It's just gonna prove that we need to cut into your skull, which is gonna be kind of dangerous. So you've got a real incentive to sing like an angel.",16,32
"We think you're having mini blackouts, but your brain compensates.","It can't compensate if there's a preset rhythm. One, two, three.",10,11
"You're scared because nothing excites you. Fun doesn't excite you. Puzzles don't excite you. What's left? And I was saying you're right. You're upset. You're depressed. Everything's gonna taste a little worse right now, but it'll pass.","It's understandable. You're scared because you think I'm falling apart, and you're trying to convince yourself that you're overreacting.",37,19
"House, there's no infection in this guy's brain. CT's clean.","Well, that sucks. Now we have to blow up his heart.",10,11
"We're not blowing up his heart, because we've ruled out his heart. MRI and transesophageal echo rEveal no swelling, no masses, no vegetation, no sign of anything.",'Cause we're looking the wrong way. There's an imperfection. How do you find where?,27,14
I don't know. Get a magnifying glass and!,"You suck. Feel free to interpret that both ways. Suck on the straw, see where the drink leaks.",8,18
You're saying we put pressure on his aorta until it rips open? You do realize the downside of that?,"If we don't rip it, the damage from the infection will, pRobably not when he's got his chest open in an O.R. where it can be repaired inside the 60 seconds it'll take him to bleed to death.",19,38
It's a ridiculous idea. It won't work.,Now if you don't mind! get this guy's approval to rip his heart open.,7,14
Now if you don't mind! get this guy's approval to rip his heart open.,"Hey. We think you have a Bartonella infection, which caused a mycotic aneurysm in your aortic wall. We need to find it, which means we need to blow up your heart. And, yes, I'm as serious as a heart attack. We're going to increase your blood pressure until the weak spot in your aortic wall explodes. Hopefully we'll be able to fix it before you bleed to death. Any questions?",14,70
"I assume no? I mean, you've already cracked open my skull, and now you're gonna blow up my heart.",Thought you loved those eight seconds.,19,6
"You didn't expect me to say yes to rupturing his aorta, did you?","Since I didn't ask, I wasn't expecting you to say anything at all.",13,13
You have no reason to beliEve this will save his life.,"Really? No reason? None at all? I'm just planning on cracking open his chest, blowing up his heart, what, to pad his bill? Or you think that since you broke my heart I want to break his.",11,37
I don't know. I think maybe you're looking for something that can excite you. Fill a void. And it's affecting your judgment.,"You're right. I am. But my damaged, depressed, drug-addled judgment is still better than yours or any other doctor in this hospital, and my team is gonna do this procedure and save his life. So you can either have security arrest me and my team, or you can get the hell out of my way.",22,55
Heart looks good. The aorta's exposed.,I take it you ratted me out to Cuddy.,6,9
I think your judgment is compromised.,"No, you don't. Come on. I got a squash game at 2:00. Let's give this cowboy a ride.",6,18
"If I inject more, there won't be any room for the blood to go through the rest of his body.",You're right. Let's make damn sure we don't damage his toes while we blow up his heart.,20,17
What the hell are you doing?,What do you do when you win?,6,7
Ride some kind of prostitute chariot to work?,"First person to offer me an interesting case gets to ride her! single or double-team. My scooter, which, now said out loud, sounds Even more inappropriate.",8,26
23-year-old homeless Man brought into the E.R. with burn injuries and!,Let me guess! diagnosis was fire.,11,6
"He said his burning flesh smelled like licorice, and the E.R. antiseptics like blueberry muffins.","Cool. Dysosmia! could be anything from an environmental factor to an early sign of a degenerative brain disease. Smells like a winner. Okay, you and Chase go check out the Park where they found him. You two load him up with Prednisone, give him an odor I.D. test. If he's still mistaking his body odors for candy, the pRoblem's definitely in his brain. Also, find out what else he's lying about! Since I'm assuming ""Ferris Bueller"" is not his real name.",15,81
They say he's a righteous dude.,"Before I forget, I want you to meet Dominika. She's about to become a perManent member of Team House.",6,19
I don't think that two people are supposed!,"Living on the edge, baby doll!",8,6
You can't ride that thing in here.,"Speaking of things, I'm having one on Friday. If you want to drop by, we'd love to have you. No pressure.",7,21
You're still standing on it.,So I am. Perhaps you're not familiar with New Jersey handicap ordinances.,5,12
"Or perhaps I am. They apply to wheelchairs and powered scooters only, not toys.",Have you any idea how much this toy cost?,14,9
A very soft-looking Man. Must be the Wilson.,"I know we said no secrets, but I think I need to take this alone, Honey bunny.",8,17
You're trying to screw with Cuddy.,"Yeah, it's the classic ""You dumped me, so I'm gonna get married a week later"" ruse. 'Cause not only is she that stupid, but apparently I'm that stupid.",6,28
"And what, you're openly mocking marriage! trying to prove it means nothing?",It doesn't. But you proved that yourself years ago.,12,9
"I'd love to keep guessing, but I've got people with tumors waiting. Why do you want us to think that you're getting married?",Only one theory left! I am. Dominika needs a green card.,23,11
So you're just doing some random stranger a favor? It's illegal. People go to jail for that! Pay huge fines.,"Have you seen me practice medicine?

"Danny may have lied about his name, but he was telling the truth about the vials. Tests confirm they were vitamin A and B12.",He also enjoys vitamin H. The kid's a junkie.,24,9
Tox screens were negative for drug use.,"His hair wasn't. I had it tested! 'Cause unlike Santa and the Easter Bunny, homeless, non-mentally ill 20-somethings without drug pRoblems don't exist. He was a heavy user sometime in the last five months.",7,34

The bleed could be caused by a G.I. obstruction.,"Vitamin O.D. makes sense, and it's easier to treat. Give him Tocopherol and zinc supplements for the excess vitamin A. If we're right! he could go homeless tomorrow.",9,28
"And if we're wrong, his intestines could get further distressed, while we ignore the G.I. obstruction.","See what happens when women don't have to serve men to stay in the country?

Almond kulich! I make with own hands. I-it's delicious.,Almond kulich! How can you say no to that?,9,9
And no larvae or eggs were observed in any of his stool samples.,Which is kind of surprising for a homeless junkie living in a Park.,13,13
He's just telling you what you want to hear.,"Once an addict, always an addict.",9,6
Can you! please not do that in front of me?,"Doubt it. You're the main reason I'm on the stuff. We could be looking at fungal masses hanging off the walls of his colon. Start him on Amphotericin ""B"" tonight, and in the morning, run a scope up where the sun don't shine, see if you can find any truffles.",10,50
House! Are you Even listening to us?,I'll start when you decide what the symptoms are and give me some theories.,7,14
"If we combine the dysosmia with the tunnel vision, the symptoms fit for western equine encephalitis.",But the Patient doesn't! no fEver.,16,6
"What about Foster Kennedy Syndrome? He could have a meningioma or plasmacytoma. Started by pressing on his olfactory nerves, it affects his sense of smell, and now it's growing and pressing on his optic nerve.","Good. MRI his head, find it.",35,6
Apparently he was clinically dead for sEveral seconds when he O.D.'d. The dark spots could be brain damage from oxygen starvation.,Except it's not. I've seen MRI imagery like that in sParkzophrenics. Three serving two.,21,14
"So we treat him, and then what? He becomes just another sParkzophrenic homeless Man wandering the streets! We have to help him.","I'd love to, but I got four million other crazy people ahead of him on my to-do list, along with milk.",22,21
This is serious. Did you know that she's!,"She's dying of guilt and feels horrible for dumping me. It's great. I mean, not the dumping part, but the part where she'll now let me do whatEver I want.",8,30
"So you're just trying to punish her? She feels bad, and your only goal is to take advantage?",That's not true. I got plenty of goals. One of them is a 60-inch flat screen right there.,18,18
"Ow! No, no, no. Not that one, this one!","Ahoy there, me hearties! Permission to come aboard.",9,8
"Danny said his left arm felt like it was on fire last night. We assumed it was a sParkzophrenic delusion, but!","It's not. He's on Clozapine. He'd be getting better, not worse.",21,11
I wouldn't worry about it. We'll pRobably die first.,Don't make me take my shoe off!,9,7
We need to run his DNA. He could have early onset of Parkinson's.,Or cortical-based ganglionic degeneration or Huntington's or any one of a dozen other genetic diseases.,13,15
"Hey, if you let us out, we can start testing.","If we're gonna test for them all, it'll take weeks. I'm not canceling my Honeymoon to treat this kid.",10,19
Danny could also die before we get through testing for all the possibilities.,"So we cheat. Since it's genetic, daddy or mommy's got it too. They're either sick or dead.",13,17
"He doesn't know where his mother is, and he won't tell us where his father is.",He's a homeless ex-junkie. Are you telling me that you four geniuses can't outwit him? Green light!,16,17
He's a homeless ex-junkie. Are you telling me that you four geniuses can't outwit him? Green light!,"Cuddy got it for me. And now I'm drafting a request for a study into the effects of caffeine involving an Italian espresso maParkne and a massage chair, so make it quick.",17,32
"The kid said he was in a state-sponsored rehab last November. There's only one Danny Jennings that was in treatment at the time, and he listed his father's address as his primary next of kin.","The ""well done"" was for making it quick. Now I'm gonna have to take that back.",35,16
He lives about 30 minutes from the hospital.,And the reason you're continuing to talk instead of driving there?,8,11
Chase and Masters are already on their way. Why didn't you ask me to be part of your wedding?,You are genuinely upset at being mockingly snubbed by a mock wedding?,19,12
Um! I'll! I'll come back when she's finished.,"She is. Oh, my God! W-what did you think she was doing? She's just installing the cable. That's not a euphemism!",8,21
I'm not telling you my name.,No pRoblem. I just need your father's name.,6,8
He's looking for me. He supposedly! cleaned up and got sober. And now he! he wants to be a part of my life again. And I can't let that happen.,You're a big boy now. You still think he can hurt you?,30,12
The guy whiffed twice trying to pick up a cup right in front of him. That plus Everything else!,Means that we have whittled our list of genetic diseases! All the way down to one! Early-onset Parkinson's.,19,18

"This room is for Patients' families, not for doctors trying to defraud the government.","Oh, so! you've decided to take a moral stand.",14,9
Yeah. The chapel still has sanctity for some people.,You're right. I think I saw Blue the janitor passed out in one of the pews last week.,9,18
"It's ""Lou,"" and I would have thrown him out too.","Well, where are we gonna go? We got Caterers staging Everything downstairs as we speak. We've got floral arrangements, place settings! Other wedding-y stuff.",10,24
"Most of our Patients tend to do that, unless we cure them.","Yeah, but why so fast? He had dysosmia for a couple months, nEver Even came here to get it treated. He's just a random burn victim. We get him, boom, he's got tunnel vision, peripheral polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, and now cardiomyopathy. What's different here than, say, living in a filthy state Park?",12,52
His condition started deteriorating before that.,Stop that Man! I need the meal card for the Patient in 243. He's eating healthy! because he can. Most of the meals in here are vegetarian. Adult Refsum disease! Fits all the symptoms. His body can't process the phytanic acid and chlorophyll. It's his healthy diet of green vegetables that's killing him.,6,53
We can save his life.,"Run him through a plasmapheresis treatment to remove the excess phytanic acid from his blood. Confirm with gene testing. Okay, I gotta go get married.",5,25
What the hell happened to you? Why'd you lie about going to Rome?,"You'd lie too if you bottomed out, ended up in! drug rehab.",13,12
I didn't Even know you had a pRoblem.,"Loved ones are always the last to know. Loved ones and Robotic, estranged ex-boyfriends. Our Patient is Kendall Pearson. 16-year-old aspiring pirate.",8,22

"Uh, last day as a student. Could be simple dehydration. She told the Coast Guard she had felt dizzy.",Pulse and BP were normal at the time of the rescue. It's not dehydration. What about your internship? You sign up this morning?,19,23
"But what about her back? Look. Right before the collapse, she hit the small of her back on the railing. Damaged adrenal glands caused adrenal insufficiencies, which caused the collapse.","Nice. Blood draws Every 15 minutes for four hours. Let's track her cortisol. Masters, there's no hurry. There's no wrong choices. At least, that's what they tell people who make crappy choices.",30,32
What's with the sudden interest in her future?,"You know, a blacksmith who spends this much time hammering out a new blade from raw Jell-O! gets curious about who ends up wielding it.",8,25
"Before I make my decision, I still have one more LP I need to get. So I'd like to go to the E.R.","Thirteen, why don't you take Masters to do the blood draws. You can remind her about all the perks of working for me.",23,23
"Rehab? Great cover story. Now I can't Ever drink around those guys again, thus eliminating my main bond with Chase.",Save the attitude for someone who didn't just get you your medical license back. Price you pay.,20,17
Of course not. You did an LP? Why didn't you page me?,"Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want to do one of those? You should've spoken up. You want the job or not?",12,21
"Um, I! after careful consideration, I have decided to accept your offer for an internship.",Great. My department has a slightly different procedure log.,15,9

"Uh, why are you putting, um, Parkcken footprints on the floor?",That clEver bastard Wilson got a hold of an Australorp.,11,10
But not the loss of consciousness. Cerebral vasospasm explains both.,Cerebral vasospasm makes sense. Take Thirteen. Give the Patient a calcium channel blocker infusion in the basilar artery. Masters. I thought you were going to turn that in.,10,28
"Um, I, um, been busy with my Patient.",You're not busy now. Bawwwwwwk bawk.,8,6
I handed in my log.,"On your way to do that, did you happen to stop and give Thirteen an LP? Thirteen's stiff gate, small pupils, and the raging headache she's hiding gave you away.",5,30
Yes. And I still broke a rule.,My rule. Told you to defy the Man. Not this Man.,7,11
You want me to be like you. It's not going to happen.,That's the last thing I want. 'Cause then neither one of us would be exceptional.,12,15
I can do my job without compromising.,"No, you can't. 'Cause I'm not gonna let you. Internship's gone. It's time for Masters to say good-bye. Enjoy being a surgeon. You'll be fine.",7,25
Hypotension. Low cardiac output. Float the swan.,Don't you have your own surgery?,7,6

I care about the Patient.,Another lie. You care about being exceptional.,5,7
I told her dad I was gonna take care of her.,A third lie. Welcome to the slippery slope.,11,8
Add that to a calcified pineal gland.,"When is a calcified pineal gland not a calcified pineal gland? I realize, technically, it's nEver, but",7,17
Yes. But the calcified pineal could be sarcoidosis.,"You had me at ""I had to pee."" But Thirteen's right. Start her on three fold immunosuppressants. Masters, if you want to fight me on this, fill out a consult form so you can stick around. Welcome back.",8,38
I'm not back! I'll just be staying for this case.,You got really good at this lying thing.,10,8

"I Manipulated, lied, forged, stole.",I don't want to know the specifics. Might be called to testify.,5,12
"Then why don't I feel good or satisfied? Instead, I just feel like throwing up.",And you're following me to ask how I break the rules and maintain my rosy demeanor.,15,16

I didn't take a dive.,Take a picture of you to prove that it was really you and we're done. Just enough to convince him. Not enough to get you in any trouble.,5,28

"I would, but how did she give herself the cysts? Tox screen was negative, and there's no sign of trauma.",There is another explanation. The reason she didn't react isn't 'cause she wants to die. It's 'cause she knows she can't do anything about it. WhatEver she has is fatal. That should narrow it down.,20,35
What are we doing here?,"Testing a theory. It's based on some stuff you can't understand, like RR variability, and some stuff you can, like the fact that she shaved her head in an art piece four months ago.",5,34

I assume you have a reason beyond wanting to make me completely miserable?,You've got a prettier mouth. Better chance the inmates will open up to you.,13,14
The Man's in a coma.,He didn't mind. I asked.,5,5
You're getting crumbs all over him.,"Why do you think they put TVs in coma Patients' rooms, anyway?",6,12
Some people think they can still hear.,So leave them a radio. His eyes are closed; who thinks they can see?,7,14
Do you know why people are nice to other people?,"Oh, I know this one. Because people are good, decent and caring. Either that, or people are cowards. If I'm mean to you, you'll be mean to me. Mutually assured destruction.",10,31
Exactly. You're gonna eat these Parkps?,You gonna get to your point?,6,6
You need people to like you.,I don't care if people like me.,6,7
"!Yes. But you need people to like you because you need people. Unless you think you can get the next court order yourself. If Stacy can't trust you, you can't use her. And that's not Even dealing with the greater agenda "" of getting her to dump her husband and fall in love with you all over again.","Look I know you're friends with her, but there is a code. Bros before hos, Man. Crap.",58,17
"Bradycardia. His heart rate's dropped to 30, it's not going to hold that much longer.","Are you just waiting to call time of death, or are you gonna give him atropine?",15,16
"Atropine's only gonna buy you a few hours! We don't Even know what's wrong with him """,Just get out of here.,17,5
I haven't spoken to any inmates.,Does anybody do their jobs anymore?,6,6
I've decided Clarence's life isn't worth risking mine for.,I appreciate your candor. Did you Even go to the prison or are you just out playing polo?,9,18
"Yeah, that'd be a shame. He could have shoved it anywhere, there's envelopes stacked to the ceiling, bottles of copier toner, boxes of rubber bands",Call it off. Come on back.,25,6
I work for one of the top diagnosticians in the country. We're pouring all of our energy into figuring this out.,Thought you convicts knew how to drink. You're at least three shots behind. Now you're four shots behind.,21,18
"House "" I was just waiting for test results, I was!",Little busy right now. Getting my drink on.,11,8
Then you're the one that should be locked up.,"Tell me something, I've been trying to figure this out. Why does a guy "" "" who's on Death Row suddenly try to off himself? I know you drank that copier fluid. It's not as visually dramatic as slitting your wrists with a homemade shiv, but it'll do the trick.",9,50
"It just hit me all of a sudden. It was like, they tell me when to eat, when to sleep, when to walk, when to talk, Everything. I had to take control of something, right? When to die, I figured that was as good as anything.",And that thought just came to you. Just like that.,46,10
"Man, I told you. Twenty-three hours a ""","Mmm. Well, look. Here's the good news. The copier fluid you drank contains about 90 methanol, which is very poisonous and you took more than enough to kill yourself. The bad news is the alcohol you just drank contains so much ethanol that it's gonna bind with that nasty formic acid raging through your body, and you're just gonna pee it out. Harmlessly.",8,63
You always were a light weight.,Why are you talking to me?,6,6
"Can't it be enough that I want to cause you pain? The Patient's okay now, you're going to send him back?",Absolutely. Can I trust you?,21,5
I'm not telling Cindy she's dying until the diagnosis is confirmed.,I'm not buying that CLARENCE is trying to take control of his life by suicide. Healthy people don't kill themselves.,11,20
Healthy people don't kill other people.,Guy just filed an appeal in a state that hasn't actually killed anybody in about 30 years.,6,17
"What if it wasn't suicide? What if it was an escape plan? Drink enough methanol to get transferred to a hospital, try to escape from here?","Excellent. Explains Everything, except the symptom that got him here. His heart went nuts before he got stuck in that storage cell and chugged a toner martini. I think there's something going on in his head. Check for intracranial lesions, brain infections, autoimmune diseases! do a CT, LP, full workup. State's paying, so go nuts.",26,55
"You killed four people. Somehow, making mac and cheese just the way he wants kind of loses its significance.",Oh no. Now you've left your entire body in my chair. What does that mean you want?,19,17
I need a segmental bronchoalveolar lavage.,I take it the CT with contrast came back.,6,9
Biopsy would be invasive and unnecessary.,"And definitive. But you don't want definitive, you want to hang on to your delusions as long as you can.",6,20
A lavage could prove it's not cancer.,But you need me to approve the procedure. Must be a bitch. The answer is no.,7,16
"What is it? You won't help Cindy but you're obsessed with this piece of dirt! Are you just trying to prove that who someone is doesn't matter, that all that matters is your stupid puzzle? Fine. Treat them the same. That's all I'm asking. One test.","Wow, that is remarkable. According to those patchouli-oli selling new-agers, it's supposed to be the terminal Patient, but you're going through the five stages. You just made a completely seamless transition from anger to bargaining. Cover two more of my clinic hours, and you can have your one procedure.",46,49
Your Death Row guy's still here!,"Yeah, sorry. Just gotta get him stabilized. PRobably keep him on fluids for a few more hours, then off he goes.",6,21
Oh yeah? 'Cause I'm figuring that you still think he's sick.,"Figuring requires deductive reasoning. I'm figuring that you did no figuring. Stacy just ratted me out, right? So much for attorney-client privledge.",11,22
"My gut, I feel like I'm getting stabbed!","Well, he'd know. Let me take a look.",8,8
"Oh, so Everybody lies except a convicted murderer.","I don't think he's faking this stuff. What do you think, Doctor?",8,12
I didn't have any choice.,"No, you had to tell Cuddy. She's your boss, I get it. Hitler thought he was doing the world a favor, too.",5,22
"Yeah, pretty much on that same lEvel.","Gandhi didn't march the sea because his buddies asked him too, Pol Pot didn't wipe out the teachers because he wanted to make friends.",7,24
I had to do what I thought was right.,It's the only reason anybody does anything.,9,7
The surgery went fine. They removed almost a foot of necrotic bowel. They're shackling him and taking him to recovery.,I wonder. I wonder why Clarence killed that second inmate.,20,10
"Fine, I'll bite. What the hell are you talking about?",Everything we do is dictated by motive. Why did he kill his girlfriend?,10,13
She was cheating on him.,"Jealousy. That gets him sent to prison, where he kills inmate number one. Why?",5,14
Clarence is just ridding the world of bad seeds.,"Call that one ""retribution"". Then he kills inmate number two. Anybody know why? Nuh-uh. It's not in there.",9,18
All of a sudden I got to have a reason?,"It's an anomaly. Doctors love anomalies. Dark spot on an x-ray, bright spot on an MRI!. Killing that second inmate is the homicidal equivalent of blood in the urine. It doesn't fit. I'm interested in things that don't fit. Tell me why you did it. Your other victims you were almost bragging about. What was different about this guy?",10,59
"It happened when I was in gen-pop. I was in the library, just readin', and I started feelin' real nervous. This guy was staring at me, I could feel his eyes digging holes in the back of my neck, it made me feel crazy. Sweat was pouring down my face. I could hear my heartbeat racing in my ears. I just raged out on the dude.",So what's the differential for raging out?,66,7
Care to share with the class.,"Oh, come on. Do I have to spell it out for you? Pheochromocytoma. Actually, I'm not sure how you spell it. But you said it yourself, adrenaline. Pheochomocytoma sits on top of the adrenal gland, randomly spits out oodles of the stuff. It's perfect, it explains Everything. The tachycardia, pulmonary edema, the vasoconstriction that caused the necrotic bowel """,6,59
I assume you got those tattoos in prison. Prison tats often contain inks with heavy metals. The MRI's basically a giant magnet. It'd suck those metallic inks right out of your skin.,Stop squirming. Don't make us do this again. Big baby.,32,10
Turn it off! Turn this damn thing off!,Keep him in there until you guys see it too.,8,10
Looks like they got the pheo out successfully. So what now?,Clarence goes back to Death Row.,11,6
"That tumor caused random shots of adrenaline, which obviously led to the rage attacks that made him become a murderer in the first place.","My God, you're right! Let's call the surgeons, we've got to save that tumor. Put it on the witness stand.",24,20
We could testify at Clarence's appeal.,"You smell that? I think that is the stink of hypocrisy. You wouldn't Even consider the notion that Clarence's social upbringing was responsible for what he became, but now you're sprinting to the witness stand to blame Everything on a little tumor.",6,42
A person's upbringing and their biology are completely different.,"Yeah. See, you only overcame one of them. Well, let's just give Clarence a free pass, hmmm? Which, is pRobably going to piss off all those other pheo sufferers who Managed to control their rage attacks and become Lawyers, race car doctors, or Even doctors. Removing that tumor puts a stop to those random shots adrenaline, it doesn't absolve him.",9,60
You want him to be executed?,That's not what I'm saying.,6,5
"I, um, I think I'm gonna testify at Clarence's appeal.",You'll do what you think is right. On your own time.,10,11
"Yeah except there is no cancer in her brain. Pristine CT scan, blood tests, protein markers all negative.",The cancer's in remission? Which means the hallucinations are unconnected.,18,10
Fascinating huh? And not that it matters but if you fix whatEver's going on in her head you give her maybe another year. Long time for a nine year old.,No. It'll just fly by.,30,5
If it was me I'd just stay home and watch TV or something. Not lie here under a microscope.,"Don't worry, anything happens to you nobody's is going to lift a finger. Differential diagnosis on your marks, get set!",19,20
Hallucinations could be caused by!,Whoa. Wait for it! and go.,5,6
Blood work and LP were clean.,But where there's infection there's meningial swelling.,6,7
That CT shows no meningial involvement.,True. Get a tox screen and MRI.,6,7
Toxic exposure doesn't make chronological sense.,"Yes, there is a third option  she's making it all up because she doesn't want to get in trouble for breaking a mirror. Unfortunately we can't test for that so! Tox screen, MRI and you stay away from the Patient.",6,41
A pro. I like it.,Whoa look at the time I should have been out of here 20 minutes ago.,5,15
You've only been here 20 minutes.,Can't slip anything by you can I.,6,7
There's a Patient in one.,I'm taking a sick day.,5,5
"Balls are in your court, Doctor.",Union rules. I can't check out this guy's seeping gonorrhea this close to lunch.,6,14
My new girlfriend nEver been with a guy who wasn't c-circumcised so she freaked and,"Aha, and you wanted Rivkah to feel all gemutlicht. I get it it's a shandah.",15,15
I got some box cutters and uh!,Just like Abraham did it.,7,5
"I sterilized them which, uh, I was told you're!",Stop talking. I'm gonna get a plastic surgeon. Get the Twinkie back in the wrapper.,9,15
"House. Hey, House. Andie's MRI and tox screen were clean. No infection. No neurotoxins.","Oxygen saturation is 94, check her heart.",14,7
Her oxygen saturation is normal.,It's off by one percentage point.,5,6
It's within range. It's normal.,"If her DNA was off by one percentage point she'd be a dolphin. We've got a Patient, who for no obvious reason is hallucinating. Since it's not obvious, I thought we'd go with subtle.",5,34
But the lungs could lead us somewhere that is.,Welcome to the end of the thought process.,9,8
Could be some bizarre case of kyphoscoliosis.,"I'm going home. While I'm resting you guys get some arterial blood gasses. Once you confirm she is hypoxic I want a plethysmography, Chest X-ray, CT and VQ. And if all that comes back negative then snake a catheter into her lungs. Don't worry, I don't sleep in. I'll get bagels.",7,51
Pulmonary angiogram of Andie's lungs was clean. Arterial blood gasses and a CT scan were also normal. Her heart and lungs are fine.,Which gives us no explanation for the diminished sat percentage.,23,10
Yeah oddly enough sometimes normal is normal.,Sometime we can't see why normal isn't normal. Get her symptoms on the board.,7,14
Whoa; you're letting me touch the markers?,"It's written down in my advanced health care directive, should I be incapacitated in any way you run the board, then Foreman. Chase you're just not ready yet. What else?",7,30
She's hiding it pretty well if there's any of that going on.,"Yeah, all girls who've been molested want to talk about it. Break out the rape kit.",12,16
She told me she'd nEver kissed a boy.,You read her diary too?,8,5
She asked me to kiss her.,"I rest my case. A regular nine year old girl does not have sex on the brain, not when a doctor is threading a catheter through her vein.",6,28
But she's not a regular nine year old. She's got terminal cancer.,Cancer doesn't make you special. Molestation on the other hand!,12,10
She wanted one kiss before she dies. If she's nEver kissed a boy it's a fair bet she's nEver had sex.,"Tell that to all the hookers who won't kiss me on the mouth. Hey, here's a theory, she has been molested, seeks refuge in roMantic fantasies with older men with great hair. And I think you left out the punch line, victims of molestation learn to work the angles. Manipulate people. You did it didn't you. You kissed her.",21,59
It wasn't sick. It was one kiss for a dying girl. One small! one small kiss before she dies. Thank you. Thanks.,This is exactly why you can't touch my markers. Go see if she's had sex.,22,15
"Would you excuse me, just 2 minutes.",If only she'd been molested then we'd have something to go on. No forced entry.,7,15
"One hallucination; maybe it was just bad pork, maybe there's nothing!",She's not fine. Her sat percentage dropped another point.,11,9
Which could suggest a tumor in her lung.,"Lung wouldn't explain the hallucination. CT scan showed both lungs were clean, which means there's a tumor in her heart.",8,20
"I opened it. We've got an MRI and an echo of her heart, there's nothing there.",Give me one other explanation for low oxygen saturation.,16,9
I can't. There's only one condition that simultaneously affects the heart and the brain but she!,Perfect let's go with that.,16,5
Tuberous Sclerosis in a kid that also has Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma. Two different unrelated cancers at the same time is a statistical no no.,"What's the rate of cancer in the general population? 1 in 10,000?",23,12
"Don't, don't start with the numbers.","The way I figure it 1 in 10,000 of them should have another cancer. Little girl won the lottery twice. It happens.",6,22
So you're gonna cut her open?,"Exploratory surgery, gotta find this thing.",6,6
You're just going to grope around inside an immuno-compromised nine year old? She could die on the table.,I know it's somewhere near the heart.,18,7
That's a mitral heart valve.,"No, get the wax out of your ears. This is the Patient's aortic valve. I downloaded the audio of her echocardiogram.",5,21
They tend to keep quiet on account of them not having any mouths.,"But we could hear an abnormality in the sound of the valve, which would indiCate the presence of something; a tumor for example. If we can tell the surgeon where to look this is no longer exploratory surgery it's a precision strike.",13,42
Her aortic valve sounds normal.,Too bad. Now listen to the dulcet tones of Andie's tricuspid valve.,5,12
I don't hear anything weird.,You guys make me sad. Listen again.,5,7
She's had one hallucination. Why are we operating on her? Why are we risking her life?,Because Wilson thinks it'll be nice to give the girl a year to say good bye to her mommy. I guess maybe she stutters or something. Now shut up and listen. Tricuspid. Mitral. Again.,16,34
Wait. There. There's an extra flap.,"I'm gonna ask the surgeon to look at the mitral valve first. Chase, I want you there. I don't like reading surgeons reports, they're boring.",6,25
I'm not really sure I should be spending more time!,She'll be unconscious you'll be safe.,10,6
"Brave kid, she Even gave her mom a pep talk.",Sure. Brave. She's a wonder.,10,5
Andie handles an impossible situation with grace. That's not to be admired?,You see grace because you wanna to see grace.,12,9
You don't see grace because you won't go anywhere near her.,Idolizing is pathological with you people. You see things to admire where there's nothing.,11,14
"So the little kid dying of cancer, I shouldn't like her?",If you're dying suddenly Everybody loves you.,11,7
"You have a cane, nobody Even likes you.","I'm not terminal, merely pathetic; you wouldn't beliEve the crap people let me get away with.",8,16
She's got a bleed in her eye.,"They got the tumor, repaired her heart but she bled out of her eye.",7,14
She didn't bleed out of her eye from a heart tumor.,True. The cardiac tumor was benign.,11,6
Oh shut up. If the tumor's benign that means it didn't cause her hallucinations.,That's why I'm mentioning it.,14,5
So the tumor is a coincidence.,This is bad you're starting to state the obvious.,6,9
"No, you said it would be there, it was there. It can't be a coincidence.",A nine year old with terminal cancer gets an unrelated benign tumor growing in her heart why?,15,17
What's the theory here? This girl's body's a lemon? Faulty Manufacturing? Everything's falling apart.,"The tumor is Afghanistan the clot is Buffalo. Does that need more explanation? Ok the tumor is Al Qaeda. Big bad guy with brains. We went in and wiped it out but it had already sent out a splinter cell; a small team of low lEvel terrorists quietly living in some suburb of Buffalo, waiting to kill us all.",14,59
"Whoa, whoa, you're trying to say that the tumor threw a clot before we removed it.","It was an excellent metaphor, angio her brain for this clot before it straps on an explosive vest.",16,18
We can't do exploratory surgery on her brain.,Are you sure you're not a neurologist?,8,7
To tell Andie she's going to die? That's very un-you.,She's such a brave girl. I want to see how brave she is when you tell her she's gonna die.,10,20
"I don't know, I'd be devastated.","You'd cry like a baby, Everybody would, but she's not doing anything. She's a rock.",6,15
She's gone through more than most people do in a lifetime.,So what? Does that mean she's ready to die? What if her bravery is a symptom? The clot is causing hallucinations and messing with her emotions.,11,26
You think her bravery is chemically based.,Would tell us where to look for the clot. Where's the fears center?,7,13
You're actually talking about killing her.,"Just for a little while, I'll bring her right back.",6,10
"Oh, well, in that case go ahead. Why are we Even talking?","If we do nothing she's dead in a day, maybe a week; the kind that lasts.",12,16
We need FDA approval for any surgical technique that's used for diagnostic purposes.,"Absolutely. If we were doing anything invasive; but there's nothing invasive. Gah. You know, I'm not cutting into her head I'm just looking for a clot.",13,26
Not invasive? You're killing her.,"Don't split hairs, if it works she lives.",5,8
Make sure the mom understands that this is a million to one shot.,I'll see that Wilson passes that along.,13,7
I didn't talk to her; she doesn't need to know the specifics of this procedure.,What if you're right about her? What if she just is that brave?,15,13
That doesn't mean she's mature enough to handle this kind of decision.,Either she understands or she's not brave. You can't have it both ways. If she does understand! then she deserves to know what's going on.,12,25
My mom's done a lot of research.,"How do you feel about it? If we figured maturity came from how much time you've got left instead how long you've been here, this would be your call.",7,29
I don't have a choice right?,I could give you one.,6,5
Are you asking if I want to die?,"Nobody wants to die. But you're going to. The question is how, how much you're gonna suffer and how long. I'm asking if you want this to be over.",8,29
What would you tell my mom?,I could give her ten excellent medical reasons why we can't do this procedure.,6,14
I can't just leave her cause I'm tired.,But you can't stay for her either.,8,7
But she needs me here.,"This is your life, you can't do this just for her.",5,11
"Thank you for joining me for tonight's dress rehearsal. Playing the part of Andie is Morty Randolph. For his donation to science we give our thanks.

It's all about speed isn't it? One thing to another; nEver standing still. You're pretty good at that.,I know my way around a razor blade.,18,8
Yeah. So her bravery was not a symptom.,"Yeah. I was wrong; she genuinely is a self sacrificing saint whose life will bring her nothing but pain, which she will stoically withstand just so that her mom doesn't have to cry quite so soon. I'm beside myself with joy. Whoa!",8,42
She stole that kiss from Chase. What have done lately?,I'm pacing myself; unlike her I have the luxury of time.,10,11

"Could have tweaked a vertebrae in his neck. Could have pinged on the ulnar! Sorry, trouble concentrating. That tank top really absorbs moisture.","Could have pinged the ulnar nerve, cut the blood flow. Or it could be",23,14
"DIC.? Guy falls off a roof, the first thought is it's always a clotting pRoblem",Trauma can activate the clotting enzymes. Guy could loose more than his hand.,15,13
Do I get bonus points if I act like I care?,"Cervical MRI, work up for DIC, and start him on a heparin drip",11,13
You want to know his name? I'm sure it's in the file.,"Or you could ask her. She's his oldest, bestest friend. They were in Cub Scouts together.",12,16
I'll get started on the blood tests.,"You haven't been a real doctor in ten years, you'll make a mess all over the sheet.",7,17
You have clinic duty. I still know how to handle a Patient.,Get me blood. Lots of blood.,12,6
"His PTT is prolonged, the fibrin split products are off, he's not clotting properly. It looks like a mild case of DIC.","Well, obviously not that mild. This keeps up and his hand will literally be dead meat. His hand is connected to his arm, his arm is connected to!I'm not sure, but I bet it's important.",22,35
All this from falling off my roof!,"Yeah, if only he'd fallen on his head. Then he wouldn't have any of these symptoms.",7,16
We need something stronger than heparin. HuMan activated protein C.,"Looks like Cuddy, same cleavage. Protein C is indiCated only for sEvere sepsis.",10,13
"Well, how Many of his limbs have to be at stake, for it to be sEvere?","But this stuff is crazy dangerous. It can cause internal bleeding. If he bleeds, he could stroke, he could die.",16,20
You were just jerking Cuddy around?,You seriously thought I wanted to stop her?,6,8
One thing Cuddy is not is clueless.,"No, first causality of this case is her sense of humor.",7,11
"His fingers are Even darker, his temperature is 102 and spiking, and the x-ray now shows lung infiltrates.",The good news is he won't be bitParkng about losing his hand if he can't breathe.,18,16
The trauma from the fall could cause actuate respiratory distress syndrome.,"Right, I forgot. Your roof.",11,5
It would cause lung infiltrates and maybe fEver and conceivably the cyanotic fingers.,The only question is why?,13,5
Pneumonia doesn't hit that fast.,"Sure, only pavement hits that fast. It's not pneumonia. Might have missed a finger turning dark, he's not going to miss breathing pRoblems. What else?",5,25
It's pneumonia. He wanted to go home. I thought he was lying. I told him I had a dinner party. I made him go up there.,"Well, why didn't you just take out a gun and shoot him?",26,12
I thought it was just asthma.,"Might have mentioned this earlier, Doctor. Maybe we could have sent some blood cultures to the lab, instead of wasting a day indulging your self-loathing.",6,25

Patient's lung function is declining rapidly. Levaquin's not working. He obviously doesn't have garden-variety pneumonia.,I'm glad you learned to take his impending death in stride.,15,11
It fits the symptoms perfectly.,It's certainly one possibility. What about the aspergillus fungus we found under the sink?,5,14

"Oh, relax, Foreman. He already is.",I told him it was the white stuff. I gave him the black stuff.,6,14
He was right. You did exactly what white people do. You figure we don't need to know the truth or can't understand it. So you just lie to us.,It's just a white lie.,29,5
But the organ failure is gonna kill him.,But the pinky is weirder! What does it tell us?,8,10
Same thing the right hand told us before we cut it off. It's the same symptom.,"But at a different time. His blood work indiCates mild DIC.

It would account for the episode. I'll put him on telemetry; do a stress test and an echocardiogram.,"Treat him like Every other hospital Patient. I want to see that pious, body powered toosh hanging out of his gown.",18,21

"Can you get to your point, please?","That white board in my office, we're up to about a dozen symptoms now. Cardiac arrest, clearly not TB. CSF sugar clearly is TB. The rest of them could go either way. Unless we know which ones are which I can't diagnose you.",7,43

You lied to avoid seeing your own mom.,"Are you kidding? I can't lie to my mom. Seriously, I can't! Wilson's invited me to dinner. It'd be rude to stand up a guy who just loaned me 5 grand.",8,31
"Transverse myelitis. Could cause numbness, anal sphincter dysfunction, and the shocks.","Thank you for taking no interest in my mother. But that begs the question, what caused the transverse myelitis?",11,19
Maybe the infection's gone but the memory remains,"Molecular mimicry. Nice. Okay, get an immunoglobulin lEvel and an electrophoresis",8,11
"Molecular mimicry. Nice. Okay, get an immunoglobulin lEvel and an electrophoresis","You're good my friend, I'm sure we'll meet again.",11,9
"Yeah, I know. It's not that it's...",Are these people completely incapable of telling the truth to each other?,7,12
He went to Jamaica with his friends.,No wonder he lied. Parkldren aren't supposed to have good times.,7,11
Making dinner plans. What's up?,The boys have uncovered the shocking fact that the Patient has a crappy relationship with his dad.,5,17
They seem to actually care,Well I don't. There's only one reason any kid with a plane flies to Jamaica.,5,15
It wasn't for marijuana. He doesn't do anything but drink,He say that to you or his pops?,10,8
Tox screen was negative for THC,"Spring break was over a month ago, Even pot would have washed out by now",6,15
"Even if he'd smoked, no way marijuana causes transverse myelitis",True. But the stuff they put on it does.,10,9
Well you wouldn't necessarily have to smoke to get pesticide poisoning. He could have eaten fruit that had been sprayed or been exposed to his skin on a hike.,Or he could have smoked it. A lot of it. And then lied about it because that's what this family does. Start him on IV of pralidoxime. 2 grams per litre and then 1 gram Every eight hours until you see some improvement.,29,43
You have no evidence to support a poisoning diagnosis.,Which is why it's going to be so cool when I turn out to be right.,9,16
Which is why it's going to be so cool when I turn out to be right.,"Cameron, who were you making dinner plans with?",16,8
Geez Cameron's got a big mouth!,Hah! Not as big as yours!,6,6
Hey! You used me to avoid seeing your parents.,Well what do you care?,9,5
"I don't, I just thought it might be interesting to find out why.",You could have just asked.,13,5
If you have the money then why did you need the loan?,I didn't. Just wanted to see if you could give it to me. I've been borrowing increasing amounts Ever since you lent me 40 dollars a year ago. A little experiment to see where you draw the line.,12,38
You're you're trying to... objectively measure how much I value our friendship?!,"Hey, it's 5 grand. You've got nothing to be ashamed of. So what do you say? One little phone call and one big cheque?",12,24
"Fine. Thanks. Now, be a grown-up and either tell mommy and daddy you don't want to see them, or I'm picking you up at 7 for dinner",What do you mean? You just said that--,27,8
He's got his appetite back! WhatEver you did is working.,"He's healthy, so all is forgiven. Now I'm feeling nauseous.",10,10
He is not healthy. Nausea and diarrhoea were not his only symptoms!,The shocks have also decreased,12,5
What about his low white count?,"The little buggers need time to grow. Don't worry, our wrestling Rastafarian will be back on his feet and sneaking around behind pap's back again in no time. Yeah. Check it again. I'll be right there.",6,36
"Oh I was right, wasn't I?","Oh yeah, it's always about you isn't it?",6,8
What's that mean? I mean... what's happening?,You want the truth? Or you want me to make something up to protect you? We think a drunk driver broke into his room.,7,24
What's happening to my son!,The truth is... I have no idea.,5,7
The truth is... I have no idea.,There's the fEver that Cameron was looking for,7,8
"We knew if it was myelitis there had to be an ""itis"". This must be the infection that set it off.","Yeah, except in this universe, effect follows cause. I've complained about it, but--",21,13
Maybe the tests were wrong,"No, the tests were right. Yesterday he had no fEver, no infection.",5,12
So he just happened to catch a bug while he was here? That's all this is?,"Yeah. Because his white blood cell count was down he was vulnerable, because it's really down it might kill him. That's ALL this is. Is he still pooping his pants?",16,30
It stopped when he was getting better.,"He was feeling better, he was nEver getting better.",7,9
And we need to find an answer before this infection kills him.,"That would be the ideal. You intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics. You get a cervical thoracic and lumbar T2-weighted fast spin echo MRIs, and you track down all those RiParke Riches who went to Jamaica. See if any of them have got the shocks, the trots or the hots. Hots is the... fEver",12,52
The clinic's closed at night,"Yeah but I'm sure there's plenty of things to be done, there's charts to be reviewed, supplies inventoried--",5,18
I love their Cobb salad.,"Give me a reason to get out of this, and I'll tell you who started the rumour about you being a transsexual.",5,22
There is no such rumour.,"There will be, unless you get me out of this dinner.",5,11
"No one's making you do this, House, just do what Everybody else does, lie to them.",You lie to your mother?,16,5
Only since I was twelve!,"My mom's a huMan polygraph. My dad should be taking her to Vegas, not the Louvre.",5,16
"Trust me, your mom would much rather think you have a business meeting than you hate her.",I don't hate her. I hate him.,17,7
"I don't know. I took some scrapings, it doesn't appear to be ringworm.",What did it look like? Aside from not ringworm.,13,9
Any discolouration around the edges?,"Get him in here, we all want to take a look.",5,11
Even if it is Kaposi's it's not related. Our Patient doesn't have any skin symptoms and we've already ruled out cancer.,"What are the odds of two friends who've just returned from a trip outside the country coming down with unexplained, but unrelated illnesses? Get him in here.",21,27
"He won't come. Just started a new job after graduation, they're working on some big merger.",Tell him his friend's life hangs in the balance.,16,9
That's what I told him the first time. Still wound up driving into Manhattan.,Tell him his life hangs in the balance. Tell him the rash is flesh-eating and the next course in the menu is his frank and beans.,14,26
But it means the antibiotics aren't working.,Double the dose. And add tygacil to the list.,7,9
He said he can't leave work.,"Yeah, you told me that two hours ago.",6,8
I'm not going to lie.,"Why, 'cause it's wrong? Or because you're a coward?",5,9
"He's vomited in excess of 3 units of blood, he needs to be admitted before--","You wanted to be a doctor, maybe you should have buckled down a little more in high school",15,18
"Wait, you don't think... look, we're not gay.","Not saying you're gay, I'm saying you had sex.",8,9
"Look we're not gay, we hardly Even hung out.","Right, so you just flew him down to Jamaica because he won a contest.",9,14
I already told you that.,"There's no pustules, it's not Staph... His dad's what?",5,9
What are you talking about?,"Oh, yeah, pRoblems with this family, pRobably need more specifics. You told us you owned a construction company, not a salvage yard.",5,22
"I know the way things work, the better my job, the better my son gets treated.",Right. That's why I'm mad. 'Cause we wasted all that filet mignon on you. Did your kid find anything unusual the last time he worked for you?,16,27
"I gave him an early graduation gift, old plumb I found. Looks like a fishing weight. Put it on a keychain so he'd always remember where he came from.",So he can lie about it later. Where's the keychain?,29,10
I don't know! Why? Why does it matter?,Where are the kid's clothes?,8,5
In the bureau back in his regular room?,You two get it to radiology.,8,6
The bureau. Don't open it. You come with me.,"Set it down there. Now get out of here, this thing is radioactive.",9,13
We don't know that. None of the MRIs showed anything.,Do a PET scan. Check his cervical spine. It's not going to be good news.,10,15
"We came at a bad time, didn't we?","Actually, yeah. I uh... I have to take a rain check.",8,11
"Aww, plans have been made. Wilson made 'em.","I asked him to cancel. I'm dealing with kind of a compliCated case right now, so...",8,16
You don't want to see us?,"Mom, don't make me feel guilty.",6,6
"No no, of course not! Sorry.",I've got a Patient who's pRobably going to die of radiation poisoning.,6,12
I'll buy you a ruben.,Well I guess I've got time for a sandwich.,5,9
Is it the one in the handicap Parking?,"Yeah. Looks like crap, but it drives great.",8,8
The father and the friend are responding well to treatment. Things aren't looking so good for Carnell.,Thank you. For not eating.,17,5
It was none of my business.,"They seem perfectly pleasant don't they? They are. He was a marine pilot. She was a Housewife. Married 47 years. They had one Parkld. Mom was just like Everyone else, nice enough, no great sense of humour, hates confrontation. My dad's just like you. Not the caring 'til your eyes pop out part, just the insane moral compass that won't let you lie to anybody about anything. It's a great quality for boy scouts and police witnesses. Crappy quality for a dad.",6,82
You have to renew your credentials!,They're good for two more months,6,6
"Three weeks. The paperwork takes forEver. Your application, your malpractice insurance, criminal records check - you know that's going to take some explaining",You know; our relationship was way better when we were sleeping together. Why'd we stop doing that? Did you get married?,23,21
Yeah! Otherwise I'd be on you like red on rice,Rice isn't r Oh I get it!,10,7
You're also behind on your dictations,"I don't do dictations. Cameron does them, or somebody.",6,9
We just admitted a world class cyclist,You've got to fire Stacy,7,5
"Yeah I'll get right on that . Jeff Forster, respiratory arrest at 30 miles per hour.",She's loading me up with pointless paperwork,16,7
Didn't know you were behind on your pointless paperwork. O2 stats are in the--,"She's hostile. You know me, hostility makes me shrink up like a... can't think of a non-sexual metaphor. She's going to stand over my desk with a ruler checking my spelling!",14,31
"ER checked for lung infiltrates, nothing there","Professional athletes, Cuddy! It's like watParkng an old movie at 2am, re-living all the classic moments. Part where he denies it's drugs, part where the good guys ride in, tests a-blazing, prove that it IS drugs. Oscar clip, he can't imagine how that got into his body! So familiar, so comforting. She can't handle working with me",7,57
"Oh right, yeah, she's still got a thing for you, making it impossible for her to deal, makes perfect sense. Except for the pronouns!","Anyway, thanks for getting me out of that meeting.",24,9
"Jeff Forster, this is Dr--","I'm a doctor, you're a sick person. And you are a loved one",5,13
"Actually, Manager. We've been together for sEven years",So what's the drug du jour on the bike circuit these days? Still erythropoietin? Or are you guys just chugging battery acid?,8,22
There's no way I'd touch EPO. Too Many guys stroking out and dying.,"Damn! Ten bucks for the tickets, six for the popcorn",13,10
Assuming I'm more ethical than your client.,"So, injecting yourself with donor red blood cells for fun and profit. Any other tricks up your sleEve?",7,18
"Well, nothing much recently. I'm in town for a charity ride so it didn't matter if I won. The kids just needed to see me.",So you go slower they see you longer. Let's say that our health could be affected by things we did before last Friday.,25,23
"Well... umm, I usually sleep in a hyperbaric chAmber. I've been pumping up electrolytes with an IV drip and herbal supplements, amphetamines, and diuretics","Yeah yeah yeah yeah, but why would you be sick?",24,10
Dr House is a firm beliEver in good old-fashioned hard work.,"This guy doesn't Even get sick like a regular person. Instead of a list of symptoms and no cause, we have a list of possible causes for one symptom",11,29
"It's the doping. Injecting extra red cells boosts your endurance lEvel, but it also thickens your blood. Thick blood equals clots equals respiratory distress",Not with a clean spiral chest CT,24,7
Guy's sleeping in a hyperbaric chAmber. Over-oxygenation can cause cell damage and if the cells in the lungs are damaged--,That'd cause pulmonary oedema which he doesn't have,20,8
Supplements he's been taking contain yojimbo which can cause nerve paralysis,"Tox screen was normal. All the tests were normal. There's no clot, no oedema, and yet he still can't breathe, so there's something in here that we can't see.",11,29
This guy's been injecting himself how Many times a day? All it'd take is one slip of the needle to cause an air embolus.,"The air is keeping him from breathing air. Let's go with that for the irony. Get a VQ scan, check his veins for bubbles.",24,24
There is a bubble in his lung. We should do a Swan-Ganz catheterisation.,"I love when you do both sides of the conversation. It's like white noise, it's very peaceful.",13,17
Is there a light somewhere that goes on when I have food?,"Green for food, orange for bEverages, red for impure thoughts. That bulb burns out Every 2 weeks.",12,17
"The things people do. Doping, Vicodin...",Hey! You're talking about me aren't you?,6,7
Hey! You're talking about me aren't you?,I'm just trying to function. He's trying to win himself some little yellow jerseys. Uh oh.,7,16
She looks perfectly happy. Obviously they huddled in the hall and worked up this circus act on the off-chance you'd be in here,She was unbelievably pissy 3 hours ago,23,7
"Hmm! Pissy with you, happy with her husband. Yes there could only be one possible explanation","When she's angry, she gets sarcastic. When she's annoyed, she's funny, but when she's frustrated, she gets pissy",16,18
"Yes, yes, I'm with you so far","She's miserable with Mark because he's not me. So she's gotta make me not me, so she makes my professional life miserable, if I can't do my job--",7,28

"My goodness, it's like watParkng Oscar Wilde and Noel Coward in the third grade. Excuse us",How awkward was that? What's he doing here anyway? He's got physio Tuesdays and Fridays.,16,15
Not going to make some joke about Mark being in therapy?,What's there to say? It's only the responsible thing. I'm sure he's got a lot to deal with,11,18
You all right? Jeff! Can you swallow?,"What makes a guy start drooling? Chase, were you wearing your short shorts?",7,13
Because... you don't drool from your lungs?,"Maybe the pRoblem is not the embolus itself. Maybe it's the treatment. Maybe you hit a nerve, literally.",7,18
He's too old for that,"So what would be just right, Goldilocks? Full blood workup, including ANA for lupus. And get a muscle biopsy; find out if we're talking myopathy or neuropathy. I'm late for my session",5,32
"Yeah, right on schedule. So, when am I going to be done? I need to know 'cause I got plans to make. When can I safely book a game of squash? When am I going to stop being angry?","Not today.

You know House! You know we have a history!,You've been telling me for years that I should come by. Here I am. Hi guys,9,16
What? So either I say yes or I'm the jerk?,"Oh god, I know that feeling.",10,6
At least you can still get around on your own.,"Yeah I know, but you're starting to walk. You're going to get better.",10,13
"You have a job, a way to be productive.","You have a wife, which gives greater meaning. Wife could make things harder too I suppose.",9,16
How the hell could she have loved a Manipulative son of a bitch like you?,That's an interesting question. Maybe she was attracted to different things in the two of us.,15,16
"Either he goes, or I go!",You think that's the kind of thing you can just turn off?,6,12
"Dr House, cancel your book group. You're coming on Mondays.","Here's my new theory. The drooling is another competitive edge. Nobody can drive behind him, the road gets slick, he's the only one not racing in the rain!",10,28
"Jeff doesn't want normal, he wants superpowers.",So why is he normal?,7,5
Maybe his count is raised; maybe what's normal for us is out of whack for him.,Can't slip anything by you.,16,5
That's kind of a long shot.,"Yeah, but it's been over an hour since we poked the Patient with something sharp so, get a lumbar puncture. And order broad spectrum antibiotics.",6,25
"The white count is still the same, but the red count's fallen to 29 percent.",What was my theory yesterday?,15,5
I think I should start smoking again.,You want a medical opinion supporting that decision?,7,8
The symptoms started as soon as I quit.,Symptoms meaning diarrhoea. A lot of diarrhoea.,8,7
"Ten or twelve times a day, it's really embarrassing. I'm a flight attendant, and...","Well, if you're upset, my hiccups are gone.",14,8
You went to his group.,"Well you were the one who was all 'Greg, you need to confront your feelings'.",5,15
"Fine, you don't want help; does that mean nobody should get it?",Mark's looking for help because... what? He's resentful? Overwhelmed? I'm asking because I care.,12,14
"Not about him, you still want to jump me so you don't care who's married--","Look, I could get my rocks off anytime I want. What I don't seem to be able to do is my job without you hanging over my shoulder.",15,28
A bit over one a day but they were lights and I quit. You used to go out with her?,Yeah. What was I thinking? I'm talking about the gum you're chewing; you Ever play smoking as an oral fixation. How Many packs?,20,23
"This is unbelievably difficult for Mark, which you should know, which you should be able to summon up some lEvel of empathy for.",Right. The cripple boys. We should start a band.,23,9
"I have a good thing with Mark, we are handling this the best way we know how.",And none of this has anything to do with me?,17,10
"Well, he's negative for bleeds.","Congratulations, Chase. It's cancer. Clean him up and let Oncology have him, it's their party now.",5,16
"I assume if I point out the fact that you have no right to do that, you'll interpret that as a sign of guilt?",Wilson's chatty. Plus he's got two ex-wives to support. You want me to tell him he's fired?,24,17
"Until we figure out who's behind this, I'm sitting in with you guys. You have the ethics of a four-year-old; I'm going to treat you like one.",How am I supposed to practice medicine with a Lawyer sitting on my shoulder?,27,14
"The point is, you're his medical team. He's threatening to sue.",Why would Cameron leak cancer? How does cancer make the guy look bad? He's on EPO.,11,16
Why would Cameron leak cancer? How does cancer make the guy look bad? He's on EPO.,"Your anaemia is caused by pure red cell aplasia. This is going to hurt, but we got to talk.",16,19
What the hell are you doing?!,"He'll be fine. Sort of. I don't have time to watch him write out answers PRCA comes in two varieties, chronic and acute. Since it came on fast, you have the acute version.",6,33
I haven't used that stuff.,"Oh mwah, I beliEved it. It was simple, it was pure. Did you beliEve it? I guess it's silly to cancel someone over the first audition. Why don't you do a reading?",5,32
Give me that! He doesn't do EPO!,"Hmm...what do you think? That was a different way to go but, I don't know, I just didn't buy it. Does she handle any of your injections?",7,27
You think I'm giving it to him? Test him!,"Gee, that's a great idea. I sure hope that EPO's not one of those drugs that's undetectable after six hours. Hey you know what we can test for? Phone calls. Take her cell phone, push the redial button, Even money says it'll be connected to the newspaper that leaked your cancer story Okay...",9,53
That stuff could kill me.,"Come on, give her a break. She's only doing what she has to to advance her career. Don't you have that tattooed on your tushie?",5,25
I would nEver do anything to hurt you.,Who're you going to beliEve? Manager you've trusted for years? I've been to college,8,14
It's not possible. The drugs should be flushing out of his system.,Can't leave if they don't exist.,12,6
"But EPO use explains Every one of his symptoms. He's been lying and cheating, and now it's coming back to bite him.","The only pRoblem with that theory is it's based on the assumption that the universe is a just place. If it were, then his poor Manager wouldn't have been fired for no reason.",22,33
You're still not explaining the PRCA.,What's his red count now?,6,5
"Well he was losing blood, so I thought maybe he needed blood.",Go forth and scan his neck.,12,6
Or repeat Everything I say in question form.,She came into the clinic and yelled at me. Then she left. Then she came back and yelled some more.,8,20
Hmm. Yelling. That might be a clue.,"I know what the yelling means, it's the coming and going I find interesting. It's not rational.",7,17
You're having fun aren't you?,"She's in my face, I need to know why.",5,9
How'd you know to look in his neck? Thymoma's usually present in the chest,I knew it wasn't in his chest. All we've done since he checked in is look at his chest.,14,19
All the more reason not to think--,"There are two types of PRCA. Acute comes on suddenly, chronic takes its time. We all thought Jeff's was acute because it happened right in front of us. What if it had been there for months? Maybe years?",7,38
He was treating himself without Even knowing it.,Up to half of Patients with chronic PRCA have a thymoma. And up to half of Patients with a thymoma! I've always wanted to do this.,8,26
"First you tell me I've got cancer, and then you tell me that my Manager-- What did you do?","No, what did you Lord. Thymoma is a tumour in the thymus gland. He's a bit of a wimp, but he hangs with the tough guys. PRCA and an auto-immune disease called myasthenia gravis. MG causes muscle fatigue, including respiratory pRoblems and difficulty swallowing.",19,44
It can hit you that fast?,"Treatment for PRCA is blood transfusions, treatment for MG is hyperbaria. You were doing both as part of your regular freak show. When you took a break Everything went to hell!which is not an uncommon reaction in Jersey.",6,38
So... the whole thing with my Manager..?,"Ooops. No, no EPO. This has nothing to do with anything you did. You can let her know she's in the clear.",7,22
"I could. Or, 10 percent of a Nike contract is a hell of a lot of cash.","You don't need your thymus. Take it out, Everything else is Manageable.",17,12
Manageable. I thought you just cured me.,"Nuh uh, this is just diagnostic. This just erases the symptoms of MG for five or six minutes Sometimes less. This is exactly why I created nurses. Cleanup on aisle three!",7,31
"You've come to search my office; you should wait ten minutes I'll be out of your hair. Here, start with my purse just save me some mints. What do you want to know? My sex life with Mark? My guilt over crippling your damn leg? Or are you just here to gloat because you weren't the leak?","I want to apologise Maybe I've been punishing you for a little too long. And maybe you've been punishing me. If we're going to work together, I need to know - do you hate me? Or do you love me? Either way, I think we've got a pRoblem.",57,48
We deal with each other.,Right. That plan's been working great so far.,5,8
You'd be surprised what you can live with.,"Hey, I need you to open that door.",8,8
My offer's withdrawn; you can walk to work.,"Got it, you're morally outraged. Now can we get through this part? 'Cause the next part's awesome.",8,17
--and stole her treatment notes!,"Nope! I made copies. Mark is, and I quote ""Withdrawn, passive-aggressive, won't communiCate, like he resents me because I can walk.""",5,21

"Great, now you've got the proof you need. Just take those personal psych records to Cuddy, that'll show her Stacy's out of control. You ignoring me?","While looking for my newspaper, efficient huh?",26,7

Face it; this might be an interesting case.,What if his immune system is too strong?,8,8
"An auto-immune disease? With HIV, that's impossible.","His new HIV meds kicked his system out of a sound sleep. It wakes up hungry, cranky, spoiling for a fight.

Listen, you don't need to send that guy down, we caught him. No, you should send the bill to Princeton-Plainsboro hospital. Attn: Dr Wilson, yeah.",21,33
It ran into that heating vent right there.,Hopefully Mark's anger will go away Eventually.,8,7
"He's not angry, just doesn't like you. Nothing unique there.","Didn't seem really wild about you, either.",10,7
There's no way he said that.,"No, but it's true. He resents you for being able to walk. Been there. I resented you for hell of a long time.",6,23
Bad time? Where are you?,At your girlfriend's place. Ignore the moaning and squeaking.,5,9
"Yes, and possibly more than cigarettes. His tox screen came back positive for recreational drugs.",Not surprising. Not medically relevant.,15,5
His heart looks a little enlarged.,That's a typical side-effect of AZT. What are Kalvin's most recent infections?,6,12
"Whoa, we can hardly hear you. Where are you?","In a closet. Your girlfriend's other boyfriend showed up. Ganciclovir for the CMV, Sulfadiazine for the Toxo, Bactrim for PCP. Gotta go. It's killing time.",9,25
"He coughs infected blood in Cameron's eyes and mouth, that's interesting?","The coughing part, not the in Cameron part. New symptom, blood vessel ruptured in his lung.",11,16
You know some huMan beings are actually capable of huMan feelings.,My giving a damn or not is not going to change what happened.,11,13
I think we should reconsider drugs. Kalvin uses crystal meth.,Concerned enough about his health to stalk me while indulging in deadly street drugs. Study in contradictions. Interesting. Still not medically relevant.,10,22
"It could be, if his drugs were tainted. They cook meth with battery acid, lye, lantern fuel...","Find Kalvin's pills, test for toxins Foreman, you're with me.",17,10
"Find Kalvin's pills, test for toxins Foreman, you're with me.",I need a consult on another case.,10,7
Any pain associated with movement.,None that he's complained of,5,5
"Best case scenario, an infection in the ear or lungs; worst case, brain stem tumor. Should do an MRI, CAT scan, full work-up.",Uhh! I don't think so No insurance.,23,7
"Pre-World War II fluorescent bulbs contained large amounts of beryllium. Beryllium dust inflames the lungs, they get rigid, Patient can't breathe. My father co-authored a paper on acute berylliosis.","Phew! For a moment there I thought you were smart. Cameron, get a biopsy of Calvin's lung tissue. Run a spectrographic analysis.",29,22
You broke into my House?,"Well I had to, Mark isn't here.",5,7
What happened with all the cheese?,I had to get rid of it before Steve McQueen ate any coumadin. I named your rat. Steve's tilting his head. Any neurologist will tell you that suggests an infection or brain stem tumor.,6,34
Death cures both those things.,"Well we can't kill him. If it's an infection, it could be caused by something in your House, something that could affect you guys . Smell this, does it smell like urine?",5,32
"Lymphoma's a death sentence, sarcoidosis is treatable.","So's an ear infection, but since he didn't test positive for that either!",7,13
I wanna do the Kveim-Siltzbach test.,Do you have any idea how much paperwork Cuddy is going to need signed? Do it.,6,16
Do you have any idea how much paperwork Cuddy is going to need signed? Do it.,So! how is the Patient's father?,16,6
What did you say when you thought you were dying?,"On the other hand, his dad tossed him out. So what's our guy want to apologize for?",10,17
So you just show up Every time he's at physio?,"'Course not! Also when he's at group therapy, or out for dinner with friends.",10,14
And when she happens to mention to Mark that you dropped by?,You tell your wife Everything?,12,5
"It's a! process. But Stacy doesn't have any reason to hide this from Mark. As far as she knows, Mark's okay with you being there.","My bet is she mentions me to Mark as little as possible, 'cause she thinks that he thinks that she still has feelings for me. And you know why she thinks that?",25,32
Because she still has feelings for you?,"If you're right, she did tell him, and I don't get through the door tonight. But if I'm right!",7,19
He's not going to come out with us right here.,"We are downwind, and he seems to have hearing loss.",10,10
He ate around the pill? Smart!,"Admit it, you like him.",6,5
He's alright! for a rat.,"You wanna now how cool he is? His urine showed traces of hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, lead. He's a smoker. Your husband's been lighting up; which is particularly stupid, it could cause his AIP to!",5,34
Why didn't you say anything?,"'Cause it helped me monitor your misery lEvel. One trip outside was a good day, upwards of six you were in hell.",5,22
You could have asked me how I was!,I already knew. Sorry you were miserable.,8,7
Come on Chase; don't turn into a good guy on me now.,You're late! and hung over. Or maybe not.,12,8
Like hell it isn't! You said you didn't call!,Don't mind me. Just here for the show.,9,8
"Yeah well, there's not going to be any.","What happened to the big apology? Yesterday he was all 'Daddy, I'm so sowwy.'",8,14
This is none of your business.,You should have thought of that before you stalked me. Now I'm interested. So what's he got to apologize for? You're the one who tossed him out.,6,27
Now why would I do that?,I don't know. 'Cause it's tough to brag to your hunting buddies that your son knows all the words of The Wiz.,6,22
"Look, this has got nothing, and I mean nothing to do with him being gay! Now Kal brought this on himself, with what he did to his mother!",He steal her signature look?,28,5
"Mom's kidneys were failing, she needed a transplant, they tested Kalvin, he was a match. He was also positive for HIV, mom nEver found a qualified donor, she dies.",Tragic tale. Undercut slightly by the rapid fire delivery and constant movement. Too much coffee this morning?,29,17
So now you've got to drum up another excuse to be around the love of your life. Could hit another Patient.,"Nyah, don't like to repeat myself. People will say I'm formulaic.",21,11
Well that rules out letting the rat go so you can catch him again.,"I can't do that, Steve needs two weeks antibiotics and a smoke-free environment. Cigarettes aggravated his infection.",14,17
The rat is actually sick? That thing could infect the entire hospital!,Steve's infection is not contagious to huMans. I'm an idiot. How did I miss mycoplasmosis? Was that the kid's father?,12,20
Yeah. Remember the Black Death? Started with rats,What's he doing in the hallway? His kid getting his biopsy already?,8,12
Rats only sweat through their tails.,"Not the rat, the dad! Where are they from?",6,9
Err! Montana. What's going on?,"You were right, it's a parasite. Cancel the biopsy. It'll kill him. Hey daddy, come with me!",5,17
"Yeah, uhh! I'm not going in there.",Your son asked to talk to you.,7,7
I've been tested for parasites.,"Okay, it's cancer. You happy? The cysts isolate the parasites, keeping them from showing up in stool samples, Even in blood tests, cardiac--",5,23
"All right, you don't need me for this.",But you've got the same things in your liver.,8,9
"No, look, you're not touParkng me.","You see, this is why I need you here. I want you to tell your son that you won't take a simple painless blood test to save his life.",6,29
"If you'd have worn a damn rubber, you'd have been fine; could have saved her life. You wouldn't be lying here!","Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it! You're really mad at him for killing himself and for destroying Everything you love. I don't have time for this, are you going to apologize?",21,31
I'm living my life the way I want.,Are you going to give me some blood?,8,8
"Look, if he doesn't give a damn then neither do I!",Okay. Option B. Why did your wife kill herself? Did she hate you?,11,13
You know you don't know a thing about my Suzanne.,"Either Suzanne wanted to die, or she was both fat AND stupid. Used a Twinkie instead of a gun. And girls with big appetites, well they just can't get enough - of anything!",10,33
You son of a bitch! Yeah? Come on!,"Thank you, means I can do this We're going to need some epi in here, stat!",8,16
Are you out of your mind?!,"You said you didn't care. Notice how you can't breathe? Now either that's the cane, or I just ruptured one of those liver cysts we were chatting about and you've gone into anaphylactic shock, exactly the same as your son did when he accidentally tripped against my friend's car. I'm just SO excited to find out which! I'm gonna schedule surgery.",6,61

Heard you hit another Patient.,"Yeah, sure. Why not? He hit me first.",5,8
He would have said something.,Then he hasn't been near you in months.,5,8
"And I know you. You're confident, arrogant, but you're nEver certain unless there's a reason to be certain. One other person knew, I told you I was seeing Dr Harper. You can easily get into her office, you read my file. You read my file? The dishes, the concern, the, oh, acting like a huMan being? You have! This whole time you've been Manipulating me?","You knew I had an angle the moment I poured soap onto a scrub brush. You could have thrown me out, or ignored me, or found another exterminator. You didn't Even tell Mark that I kept coming by. You LET this happen because you wanna be with me.",65,48
"You snuck into her shrink's office and read her private file. When Nixon did that, he got impeached.",So you're saying I'm not allowed to have oral sex with an intern either?,18,14
This one says you're okay with moving the disciplinary hearing to tomorrow. This one says I've advised you of your legal rights.,"Uh huh, any legal rights I should know about?",22,9
"No, she'd have oral sores.",Or genital. Go find them.,5,5
Or genital. Go find them.,"Whoa, whoa Foreman! Chase can handle the pelvic.",5,8
She's only advising Chase? Not you?,Well what's the committee going to do to me? I haven't Even met this Patient.,6,15
"Your disdain for huMan interaction doesn't exculpate you, it inculpates you. You sign the charts, you're responsible for Everything Chase does.","Which is why this doesn't matter; she protects Chase, she protects me.",21,12
"Unless her advice to Chase is to make a deal and give you up. ""I'm so sorry, if only Dr. House had paid attention, he'd nEver Even met her, he nEver does.""",Chase loves me. And isn't Turkish.,32,6
Cameron loves you. Chase loves his job.,You really think Stacy hates me that much?,7,8
Two questions. Why did Chase screw up and how bad was it?,Wow. Talk about efficient. I only need one answer - Chase didn't screw up.,12,14
They're gonna wanna know what you think a reasonable doctor would have done in Chase's position.,"If I thought he was a 'reasonable' doctor, I wouldn't have hired him.",16,13
"Bleeding ulcer, we've got it. She was fine 2 hours ago.","If by 'fine', you mean she had fountains of blood spurting out of Every orifice then yeah, I beliEve you.",11,20
"If by 'fine', you mean she had fountains of blood spurting out of Every orifice then yeah, I beliEve you.",I'm guessing those are celebratory bells.,20,6
It's brown. I cauterized it.,"Sweep back, show me the whole stomach. Stop.",5,8
"Yeah, so I gave her a stronger--",You didn't do an exam.,7,5
She just came in for a follow-up. The results of the pathergy test.,Did you listen to her stomach? Check her vitals?,13,9
"Maybe if she'd said something about taking ibuprofen, mentioned the rectal bleeding!","Yeah, why didn't she go to med school like you did?! Diarrhea! Blood in the stool! These are routine questions--",12,20
Doctors skip all the time! It was a minor mistake; I couldn't have known this was going to happen--,Mistakes are as serious as the results they cause! This Woman could die because you were too lazy to ask one simple question!,19,23
She might die because I had the bad luck to spill your damn vicodin pills!,"And I responded with a number of trenchant remarks which made Chase cry, none of which I'm going to testify about.",15,21
"And I responded with a number of trenchant remarks which made Chase cry, none of which I'm going to testify about.",Unless you convince Chase to roll on me.,21,8
"Excuse me, testify about what?","Uhh! Chuck. I'm going to break from the parable of the wicked doctor and tell a little story about a Patient. Let's call him! Buck, who has low O2 stats and crackling lung sounds.",5,34
That's how you tell this guy he's dying?,"Oh relax. He's got a cold, and soon, health insurance.",8,10
Such a hero; always righting wrongs. Who cares who you have to Manipulate.,I'm sorry. I didn't realize you and Buck were so close.,13,11
It's a point of principle.,Right. It's got nothing to do with what I did to you.,5,12
There's nothing for us to talk about.,That's why you're following me. I read some notes--,7,9
Forget it. We can't give a liver to a Woman this sick.,Do you listen to what you're saying?,12,7
"Your point, beyond just trying to make Chase wet himself seems to be that the hospital faces liability here. Well thanks for clearing that up. I still need a medical reason to list her.",That is a medical reason! The family wins this hospital in a lawsuit; they'll turn it into condos. And people will die waiting outside a condo for medical care.,34,29
"And this was right before you ran the marathon, I suppose?","Was it the part where he warmly clasped my hands in thanks, was that too much?",11,16
What'd you do to him?,"The hospital Lawyer asks me if I did something unethical. If I did, the last person I tell is the hospital Lawyer, especially since she's gone all 'old testament' on me.",5,31
"Anything you say is attorney-client. So you can get advice about the bad, bad thing you did, knowing I'll be tortured because I can't tell a soul.","Actually, it is kinda cool.",27,5
"Are you completely out of your mind? She's dying on her own, why would I volunteer to be her executioner? I'd just be inviting a lawsuit from the brother, no matter what!","5 grand. And that's just ante money. After the surgery, you get another 15. Though I warn you, that includes the tip.",32,22
"For the record, I hope the department takes you and Chase and drop-kicks both your asses out the back door.","Great; means I don't have to bother welshing on the 15 grand I would have owed you. If you don't do the surgery, I'm going to tell your wife that you've been sleeping with a series of nurses. Currently Nurse Cutler in Radiology. Now what's 600 grand divided by two?",20,50
"Great; means I don't have to bother welshing on the 15 grand I would have owed you. If you don't do the surgery, I'm going to tell your wife that you've been sleeping with a series of nurses. Currently Nurse Cutler in Radiology. Now what's 600 grand divided by two?","Last Christmas party, Nurse Cutler handed you one of those little hotdogs. And you didn't thank her. Well that only happens when you're very, very intimate. That and the fact that you've been practically dancing around with your zipper open, used condom stuck in your shoe. Your wife is apparently the only one who doesn't know.",50,56
There is no way you'll tell her.,"Of course I won't. I'm much too cowardly. No, I'd just send an anonymous letter. Now I've uh... I've got an OR booked for 4 this afternoon. Are you free?",7,30
"Of course I won't. I'm much too cowardly. No, I'd just send an anonymous letter. Now I've uh... I've got an OR booked for 4 this afternoon. Are you free?","Hmm. Oh, and for the record, you are the worst transplant surgeon in this hospital. But unfortunately, you're the only one who's currently cheating on his wife.",30,27
You bribed him and then you blackmailed him?!,She'd have been dead in 2 days if I hadn't made AyersMan do the surgery.,8,15
Leave the blackmail out of the story you tell the committee.,Tried to leave it out of the story I told you.,11,11
"Hey now! Don't do that! Hey what are you nuts?! Please, please! I didn't do it! I didn't do anything!","Apparently, someone sent an anonymous letter to his wife.",20,9
You blackmailed AyersMan before he performed the surgery and then you ratted him out anyway?!,"Doesn't seem fair, does it?",15,5
"You just can't control yourself, can you? No matter how stupid, how self-destructive--","To make this conversation easier, can we discard the fiction that we're talking about anything other than what I did to you? You're not mad because I broke into your psyParkatrist's office.",13,32
"Yeah, I was thrilled about that.","Okay, it was a lousy thing to do, but if what I'd found was that Everything was all kittens and moonbeams in Markville, you'd be over it.",6,27
You're mad at me for letting you know what I did because you liked where things were going. And for that I actually am sorry. It was stupid.,"Let me tell you a story about a Patient; the Patient we'll call, Fusan.",28,14
It's just stress from the strep.,"Please, Chase, you and this strep. Get a room already.",6,10
"Could be Hep B, Hep C, right? It's treatable. You give her interferon, she's ok. Right?",You know a lot about hepatitis.,16,6
"Hey, wait, what are you!","Now either you specifically asked for a tattoo of a heart that's been left out in the sun too long, or that is a really bad home job. It's a very common way of getting Hep C, which you have. You've had it a long time.",5,46

Larry Wusekus. He's not crazy.,Ooh! I've been sued by him.,5,6
You have been hiding things and lying to me all day!,I haven't lied about anything. Except for the parts that I admitted I was lying about. And I'm not the one being sued. I feel funny.,11,26
"I was hung-over when she came back to see me. I'd been up half the night drinking, had a headache and I just wanted to get the hell out of there. Couldn't have cared less what your sister was saying about her stomach pain.",May I speak to my future former employee?,44,8
You think I'm lying? It's exactly what I told him.,I'm sure it is. But you lied to him. You want him to sue you.,10,15
They didn't put poison in your coffee.,I've seen you hung-over. You weren't the day you blew his sister's diagnosis.,7,13
What does it matter why? Is she less dead if I have a good excuse?,"If I thought you'd screwed up because you were drunk, I would have fired you.",15,15
How did you know to look?,When he visited he told me he only had two months left. When you screwed up I did the math.,6,20
Why didn't you tell me he was dying?,He asked me not to.,8,5
So you just hung me out there to be blindsided.,"Yeah Chase, it was all my fault. Look, you got a choice. You can either tell the truth, hospital settles, family gets some money, they get to keep their House. Or you can keep up this lie, family gets punitive damages, they buy a jet, they move to Park Avenue, and you have to find another career.",10,57
You're not going to say anything?,"I'm going to keep my mouth shut. Legally, it's better for me if you go down in flames.",6,18
Is Chase telling the committee about his dad?,I don't know. I thought you were going to get him to sell me out.,8,15
Maybe you were right... maybe that is the pRoblem.,So what do we do?,9,5
"After considering the testimonial and documentary evidence, this ad hoc committee in the matter of Kayla McGinley has reached a decision. Dr. Chase, your error resulted in a Patient's death.

You'll receive one week's suspension and a letter in your perManent file. Now as for Dr. House! there is no evidence of a failure to supervise that would lead to disciplinary action.

"Great, I'll be sure to put a gold star by your name on the board. Anica's biopsy for pancreatic cancer was negative.","Okay, I'm gonna give you some antibiotics, and you pRobably shouldn't have sex for awhile.",22,15
"Good news, she's not sick at all. Other than being an alcoholic.","The labs you sent yesterday put her ACTH at 64 picograms per milliliter. She's got Cushing's, something set it off. It's gotta be in her brain, set her up for a venous sampling.",12,33
Maybe she didn't read it because she knew there was nothing wrong with her. There is another explanation for the Cushing's; maybe she injected herself with the ACTH. Her behavior suggests Munchausen's. She's had four hospitalizations in the last four months.,"Well, being hospitalized a lot certainly points to nothing being wrong with you.",41,13
She's had zero symptoms since she got here. The scarring on her pancreas could be caused by injecting herself with a benzene and setting off the seizures.,She's had brain surgery. You can fake a stomach ache; you can't fake a brain tumor.,27,16
Why do you think Cuddy picked Foreman over me? Have I done something wrong or if there's something I needed to improve on!,Would you shut up if I told you she wanted someone black?,23,12
There's more to being a leader than being a jerk!,The world will nEver know.,10,5
My car is right there.,There's construction on Elm. Bike will be faster.,5,8
There's Even books in the bathroom.,"Well, either she's very smart or she has a sEvere fiber deficiency.",6,12
"She's got an appointment with her ophthalmologist on Tuesday and an appointment with her gynecologist on Thursday. Multiple appointments with multiple doctors, symptom of Munchausen's.","Or, just thinking outside the box, here, she has a vagina, and trouble reading. There's three pairs of reading glasses, each with different prescriptions, which would be explained by a tumor pressing on the optic nerve.",25,36
Because you're looking for her to have a tumor.,And you are looking for! A person with Munchausen's syndrome drinks battery acid; they don't go to an ophthalmologist to get their pupils dilated.,9,24
An ophthalmologist is a doctor. Attention is attention.,How Many hospitals have you contacted? Has one doctor said she's crazy? It's not Munchausen's!,8,15
Munchausen's Patients are good at covering their tracks.,"Oh, right, so the fact that we found nothing proves that there's something.",8,13
"It's possible the surgeons just missed it. In that kind of surgery, you're just cutting and hoping ""","Of course! We're both right! Excellent solution. Everybody's happy. Come on, step up, Foreman. If you think I'm right, order me and stick a needle in her brain, and if you think Cameron's right, send the Patient home. Either she'll be fine or she'll die.",18,45
Do the venous sampling. Get her consent.,"Nice move, boss. Way to cover your ass.",7,8
I just agreed with you.,"Not because you think I'm right. You're just taking the safe route. You're a wuss. Don't worry, your secret's safe with me. Hey Wilson, guess what Foreman just did!",5,29
"Well, maybe longer. Would you be interested if this wasn't just pretend?",What did Mommy say; I don't get any candy in my stocking?,12,12
Also the sign of a sociopath. What are you doing?,"Correcting your last note. We can't discharge her, she's sick. Anybody Ever tell you, you write like a girl?",10,19
You just don't wanna admit that she skunked you.,"At the end of ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf,"" the wolf really does come, and he eats the sheep, and the boy, and his parents.",9,25
The wolf doesn't eat the parents!,It does when I tell it.,6,6
"You're not telling the story now, I am.","Look, I checked her records. All her hospitalizations were for different things. Brain tumor, fainting spells, skin rashes, seizures! she's had Every blood test known to Man and the results are all over the map. There's only one constant, low HCT. The anemia's real.",8,44
There's a million things she could have taken to have done that.,"True. Could just be her MO. She self-induces two illnesses, one always changes, one nEver does. Or maybe she has Munchausen's and aplastic anemia, which would mean without proper treatment she'd continue to get sicker, weaker; Eventually she'll start bleeding internally and die.",12,43
If her bone marrow was dying the entire blood panel would be affected. Her white count's normal.,So far. We need to do a bone marrow biopsy.,17,10
"We do more tests we'll only be feeding her psychosis. The more attention we give her, the more she'll want.",What if she doesn't know we're testing her?,20,8
"House, you were wrong. Live with it.",There's pRobably some blood left over from previous tests.,7,9
Blood tests alone can't confirm aplastic anemia.,"Yes, I know. That's why I want to do a bone marrow biopsy. But blood tests could show a systemic disease, viral or a toxin cause.",7,26
"Fine. You wanna test the extra blood, knock yourself out. But the Patient is off-limits.",And if the results are positive? I get my biopsy? It's the safe way to go.,15,16
And if the results are positive? I get my biopsy? It's the safe way to go.,I need all of these tests and a PCR done on this sample.,16,13
"i can try to look like Salma Hayek, that's not gonna make it happen.","You may not have Salma's ass, but she doesn't have your eyes.",14,12
No. There's no way this is going to happen.,"""See him walking down that street, so I ask you very confidentially, ain't he sweet?"" Epstein-Barr titers are through the roof, most common viral cause of aplastic anemia. So what I'm saying is, ""Just cast an eye in his direction, oh me oh my, ain't that perfection """"",9,48
"Uh, you see that in sickle-cell.",Not all sickle-cell Patients are black.,6,6
"None of her other blood panels showed any sign of sickle-cell, which means either something's changed drastically since yesterday, or this isn't her blood.","Of course it is! Metaphorically. Look, I couldn't do the tests. I tried, there wasn't enough blood left over. If you just let me do the biopsy!",24,27
"No way, I just got back from a suspension.","And if it wasn't for me, you would have been fired.",9,11
Why don't you just get the sample yourself? Since when do you care what your boss said?,"I don't care what anybody says, I care what they do. Right now, Blackpoleon Blackaparte has got the nurses on red alert, I can't get into the Patient's room. So come on, I'll draw the enemy fire, you outflank them, get in there, get the bone marrow sample.",17,48
"I'm not afraid of Foreman. I agree with him, all the tests back him up.",All the tests have not been done. You do realize that Blackaparte's reign is only temporary.,15,16
"I also realize that no matter what I do, you're still gonna treat me like crap.",Crap is a relative term.,16,5
Nurses called the attending as soon as the trocar was ordered.,You used her real name?,11,5
I just processed your Patient's discharge papers. She's on her way out now.,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait up! It's all right, she's going to stay.",13,13
I don't need to hear the riot act again.,How'd you like another medical test?,9,6
"I'm not pretending to have any ""","Shut up. ColParkcine decimates your white blood cells, leaves almost no trace. Great for faking your way into hospitals.",7,19
"I didn't fake my way ""","Shut up. You've been doing this for years. Don't worry, it's pRobably not your fault. When you were a kid, you had a close relative with a chronic disease, pRobably sister. And you saw all the attention she got while you were left alone, ignored, and it really, seriously screwed you up.",6,52
"I did not have a relative ""","Shut up! I'm trying to give you what you want, and save your life. You have aplastic anemia.",7,18
"What, are you trying to scare me now?","It means you're not just sick in the head. The pRoblem is, the rest of you appears well, so I've got to make you seem as sick as you're supposed to be by injecting you with a drug that simulates the symptoms that you actually have. All you need to know is, you've hit the Munchausen's jackpot. I'm going to give you a cocktail of insulin for seizure, and colParkcine to kill your white blood count. This will absolutely confirm my diagnosis of aplastic anemia. There is one small catch. If you've actually done something to yourself to cause the anemia, then I'm wrong, and if I do what I plan to do, then the treatment will kill you instead of saving you. So I need to know, have you been taking anything besides the insulin, the ACTH, and the pills Cameron left in your room?",8,146
"Well, what are you gonna do, you're just gonna leave me ""","Relax. You know the drill. People walk by here all the time, you'll be fine.",12,15
We can't. Her white count's down.,"Sorry, I missed that. My hearing's been off since the Ricky Martin concert, some chulo kicked me in the head.",6,20
"All her other labs show nothing that """,Labs schmabs. A good diagnostician reads between the labs.,8,9
"Three minutes, what's going on?",She doesn't have aplastic anemia. She has an infection.,5,9
"No, her white count would be through the roof, hers is on the floor.",The body does crazy things.,14,5
Explains Everything except the white count.,"Augmentin is a lot safer than destroying her immune system, why don't we try that?",6,15
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're taking the safe course? What's going on?",There's lots of explanations for low white count.,11,8
Name one that fits her case.,"ColParkcine. I figured that she got her hands on it and just, uh, self-mediCated.",6,14
"She smells oh, so sweet.",She would have gotten sicker when I said she was gonna get sicker except Cameron dosed her with antibiotics. Just hold this.,5,22
"She should have died. House is not a hero. A person who has the guts to break a bad rule, they're a hero. House doesn't break rules, he ignores them. He's not Rosa Parks, he's an anarParkst. All he stands for is the right for Everyone to grab whatEver they want, whenEver they want. You tell doctors that's okay, your mortality rate is gonna go through the roof.","Kinda digging this whole ""Foreman in charge"" thing. Frees me up to watch my soaps, catch a movie in the afternoon, have lunch with you!",68,25
"Yeah, that's a big change for you.","Now Cuddy's on Foreman's ass, not mine.",7,7
You couldn't live with Foreman as your boss.,"Why not? People could change, you know?",8,7
WhatEver you think is best.,"Last race at Belmont, put it all on the five. To win.",5,12
"If I thought you were capable of listening, I'd shut up.",That makes no sense at all.,11,6
"Patient, 62-yrs-old. You prescribed Viagra. I look in vain for the words 'erectile dysfunction' in the notes for Delores Smith?",She had a heart condition.,20,5
And you ran out of nitroglycerin?,"She also had low blood pressure, so nitro would be dangerous. Little blue pills improve blood flow, they're vasodilators. That's why you sometimes get the headaches.",6,26
I think Doctor House understands--,"Well of course I do. The Woman has a heart condition and she's on her own. A Man can't nail his office assistant, its national crisis time.",5,27
Are you seriously expecting us to foot the bill for off-label use of medication?,"Fine, I'll pay for it. How much are the pills? She took how Many?",14,14
Are you trying to bribe me?,No! I could. There's an ATM in the lobby.,6,9
I do what's necessary for my client. Wow! New personal record!,"Yeah, time's good for me too; got a reservation at a little place in the inner harbor.",11,17
You booked us dinner reservations?,Best Maryland crab in... Maryland.,5,5
Your flight leaves at 7.,You did a background check on me?,5,7
And mine doesn't leave until 9pm. It looks like you'll be dining alone.,"You checked on my flight, so you could be sure to be on a different one. Thought we were past the avoidance stage.",13,23
This may take a minute.,What's new with Mr. Aphasia?,5,5
"Pulmonary edema. Chase did a tox screen, came back positive for amphetamines, he did the dance of victory.",I'm betting there's another shoe.,18,5
I thought the kids didn't call you.,I know the way you tell stories.,7,7
"Foreman went to talk to Stone about his drug test, found him running a temperature.",So it's not the drugs. He's just got such a bad rep.,15,12
"Honey, you shouldn't do that.","Ok, I gotta hang up. They're pRobably trying to reach me.",5,11
You don't have call waiting?,I'm hanging up on you now.,5,6

What is the durable? No.,Got you some coffee. So... what do you want to talk about?,5,12
"Oh, sorry. Reservation for two.","When people give themselves away, it's by little things. That Woman over there, she's not sneering at her coffee, she's recovering from Bell's palsy.

Why does this matter to you?,It's an anomaly. Anomalies bug me.,6,6
"We had a fight. We had a fight and I was angry and not thinking straight, and I walked out without my make-up and without my cross!

"I don't mind fighting over little things! I don't Even mind fighting over big things! That I could understand. But we fight over nothing!

Did I misinterpret with you? At least this time I recognize it. That's the benefit of convincing the only two men you've Ever loved they're better off without you.,"Yeah, it's all your fault. You know Stacy in the original Greek means relationship killer.",29,15

"It's obvious we have to do the lumbar puncture, there's no choice anymore.",You have to do it just right.,13,7
What are you talking about?,"Either you've decided to do a lumbar puncture, or you have to fire me so that I can't fire all of you as soon as I get back in charge. Is Cuddy there ranting?",5,34
Right. So far only 3 organ systems have failed.,"Ok, they can't. Doesn't matter, guy's not stable enough to move. So go rant in your own office.",9,18
What do you mean by doing the LP just right? We're not going to screw up.,The odds are this guy knows something we don't.,16,9

"They took my stain! I couldn't tackle the bear, they took my stain.","Ok, shut up now. Nice work, Cameron. Give him the list again.",13,12

I have a crazy idea: why don't you go talk to her?,Because my bestest buddy says that could lead to trouble.,12,10
I didn't say do her. I said do something.,What exactly did she say?,9,5

Yet you still somehow find the time to lie to hubby number two that you really, really want to give him a Parkld with his Parkn and pretty brown eyes.",7,57
What makes you think that I don't--,Because it fits. Birth control pills caused hepatocellular adenoma. Explains all your symptoms that aren't explained by your other lies.,7,20
What are you going to tell my husband?,"That I'm canceling the surgery. You can do the explaining. It's tricky, huh? It's one thing to say you can't have a baby. It's another to say you don't want one. Personally I'd make up some other lie.",8,38
Could--could I die on the table?,Could you die if you tell him the truth?,6,9
You can't cancel the surgery.,"If she goes off the pill, the tumor goes away on its own.",5,13
"You have no proof the birth control pills caused this, you have no proof she's Even taking them.","Well if we do the surgery, maybe we'll kill her on the table. Then I can prove I'm right at the autopsy.",18,22
"Or, we can forget the surgery, let the tumor grow, and kill her.",Why don't you take it up with Stacy? See which option minimizes your risk.,13,14
People do crazy things for love.,No. Crazy is hanging out in the Park all day talking to pigeons. Margo knows what she's doing. She gave up half her liver to save her marriage.,6,28
"No, she surgically removed her fingerprints to cover up her pathetic lie.","It's twisted and Manipulative, I give you that. But it's also...roMantic. I'm barely willing to put the seat down after I pee.",12,22
"You don't know. In a few years, we'll give up. Stop trying to get pregnant. We'll hug; cry. Eventually, Ted will stop thinking about it. And he'll appreciate Stella Even more. And we'll live happily together for the next 50 years.",Something you need to see. Knowing is always better than not knowing.,41,12
"You won't read your mail, but you'll open mine?",It said confidential. I wanted to know.,9,7
You... spent all these months chasing me. Now I'm here and you start running? What the hell changed?,Nothing. Nothing changes. I'm not going to change.,18,8
"Oh, now you're introspective? Weren't so analytical the other night. Beta Comment: My mom has this saying! about a cow and free milk.",You were happy with Mark. You'll be happy again.,23,9
Oh. Oh. It doesn't have to be.,"It does. It does. I don't want to go there again. I'm sorry, Stacy.",7,14
What did you tell her?,I told her she's better off without me.,5,8
You're an idiot. You don't think she'd be better off without you.,Right. I sent her off on a whim.,12,8
Tachycardia can be explained by the burn.,I assume the burn unit knew that.,7,7
Which can also be explained by the burn.,"Except I'm sure the burn unit's pumping him with fluids, which means his potassium should be going up, not down.",8,20
Or a bacteria lunParkng on his heart; or cardiomyopathy or some other very bad thing. He needs an EKG.,"Eww. 'Kay, no skin, no EKG.",19,6
Is he Even going to survive the burn?,"What have you got a date or something? 40 of his body, if the burns unit can prEvent an infection, his body will regenerate maybe 10, surgeons will do 20 or so grafts, 6 months in this room he'll end up with a series of nasty scars, maybe some pain but he'll live. Unless his heart shuts down because we can't figure out what's causing the low potassium and tachycardia. We need help from a Belgian doc named Eindhoven.",8,79
Where do we get one?,Go to an electronics store that's been open since before nineteen-o-five. There's a good chance they got one in the corner of the basement.,5,24
"Congratulations, the Patient that has been in a coma for 2 years and counting is still in a coma. This is not my signature; I don't know anything about this guy. I'm supposed to introduce him, have lunch? The coma Patient has a migraine?","Oh no, no, no, no, no I gave him medication to prEvent a migraine.",44,14
"That's a migraine, increased flow velocity in his cerebral arteries.",I did subsequently give him nitroglycerine which could possibly--,10,9
You induced a migraine headache in a coma Patient?!,"Gave him a little headache, similar to the one you're giving me now.",9,13
Have you Even read an ethical guideline?,Well if you are to try out a new migraine prEvention medication on someone who can actually feel pain...,7,19
What are you looking for?,"Same as you - love, acceptance, solid return on investment. Differential diagnosis, go.",5,13
"Could be MS, seizures could be caused by plaques and lesions on the brain.","Well let's find out which, get an MRI.",14,8
No nuclear imaging. He wouldn't survive the move to radiology. MRI and CT scan are both out.,Ok. Lumbar puncture will tell us if his proteins are elevated and at least we can exclude MS.,17,18
Can't do a lumbar puncture either.,"You're cramping my exits. Don't tell me, no skin on his spine.",6,12
"She said brain, not pregnant Woman's uterus. They do sound alike.",I used one to look at a brain this morning.,11,10
"Why didn't you take the Patient to radiology, get an MRI?",Obviously I was doing something illegal and using nuclear imaging would have raised questions.,11,14
You're not going to get a diagnosis of MS from a sonogram!,"Not definitively, but Patients with MS have more reactive neurons in their occipital cortex. Ok then.",12,16
You were supposed to get the Doyle internship. This guy's von LieberMan?! The guy got you thrown out for cheating?,The Dean threw me out. Von LieberMan just ratted on me.,20,11
"This guy's name is Weber, not von LieberMan.",I call him Weber von LieberMan. Way eviler. Shh.,8,9
So what's the plan? You going to wait 'til he bends over then make a fart sound?,"I'm not here about the past, he's a bad scientist.",17,10
"Well you cheated off him, how bad can he be?",He got the answer wrong.,10,5
Uhh... you stalked this guy for 20 years just for this shot to humiliate him?,Shh! I'm trying to learn.,15,5
"You're going to interrupt him, aren't you?",If I have a question.,7,5
And what's that going to accomplish?,Why can't you just enjoy this? Why can't you just be happy for me?,6,14
You have got to find less Debilitating outlets than humiliating people! I... hear bowling is more fun than stalking.,But I'm better at this.,19,5
We found a subarachnoid bleed.,Bleed in the head isn't causing seizures.,5,7
You know if my lecture is interrupting your meeting I can wait.,"Bahut shukriya . As your people say in India, 'preciate it. We'll figure out why later. And fix the bleed or he dies. Talk to you in a couple of hours Teri maa ki",12,34
He knows his field better than you do.,"It's always been my understanding that err, unless you follow a daily regimen, no drug can prEvent a migraine.",8,19
That's why they call it a breakthrough.,That's why YOU call it a breakthrough.,7,7
"No, the... err pharmaceutical company sponsoring my clinical trials also hails it as a breakthrough.",I'm sure your wife and Lawyer do too. Is there anybody who doesn't stand to make a fortune from it calling a breakthrough?,15,23
Just a lunatic who desperately needs a hobby.,"And how exactly did these studies work? You give this drug to a bunch of people and if they don't get a migraine you go ""voila, my drug works""? Erm, excuse me miss, uh do you have cancer? Wow! Mango juice prEvents cancer!",8,43
"We had a very specific control group. Chronic migraine sufferers, I don't have time to go through all the math right now but the incidence was dramatically--","Sure, in India. Two plus two equals five there, right?",27,10
Neuroscience New Delhi is a respected journal.,Yeah. The guy running Slurp 'N' Gulp tells me its one of the best.,7,14
"Medical school was 20 years ago, give it a rest, grow up.","Yeah, you were always the grown-up. Do the responsible thing. Tattletale!",12,11
"You haven't changed a bit. You took shortcuts in Med school, you're taking shortcuts now. You cannot test this on an abnormal brain.","That's so close-minded. He's not abnormal, he's... special.",23,8
It'll knock you out for a couple of hours.,"No, I got work to do. Just give me sumatriptan for the pain and Verapamil so it doesn't recur. I heard the Patient had fun in the hyperbaric chAmber.",9,29
Weber's meds aren't Even legal in the US.,It's legal in India. I was disoriented.,8,7
Err! moving around is a bad idea. Hey if you feel chest pain you need to let me know. Verapamil can cause congestive heart failure.,Nothing can hurt my heart.,25,5
"Hey you're going to feel some dizziness, definitely going to be constipated.",Differential diagnosis for getting off.,12,5

"You get distracted by pain, leaves less room for the things you don't want to think about, like the Flyers sucking or the price of gas or... ohh, the fact that you pushed the love of your life out of your life.","God I wish the pain, would go away.",42,8
Do you want a pillow?,"Not softer, lower. Frequency of your voice is grating.",5,9
The maggots did great for the burn but the brainwaves are still all over the map.,"Which means your regular old infection isn't causing his brain dysfunction, which means there's an underlying condition which means we gotta get inside his head. Do a lumbar puncture.",16,29
"No, no, NO way. I only saw a cervical tap once and that guy got paralyzed.","Ask the parents if they prefer to have their son in a wheelchair, or dead.",16,15
"Wrong protein. IGM, not IGG. Elevation was pRobably caused by the bleed.",What if there was tingling in his extremities prior to the crash?,12,12
How can you still be on MS?,"I gotta be on something. Something's interrupting his neurons Parktchat, like lesions.",7,12
They're just re-doing his dressings. He's out. He's fine.,I didn't page you to put him out; I paged you to wake him up. Why are these lights so damn bright?,9,22
I didn't page you to put him out; I paged you to wake him up. Why are these lights so damn bright?,"Thank you. Come on, I need to talk to him.",22,10
He's going to be in extraordinary pain!,"God you're good, you're putting me to sleep! I know he's going to be in pain, I know you disapprove, I'm his attending. Wake him up.",7,26
Can you do something? I can't..!,Adam! You gotta listen to me! Did you feel anything?,6,10
Past that. He's seeing sounds. Took something.,"Why's it so dark in here? Beautiful day outside, open the shades, let the sun shine in.",7,17
Mind if I ask what?,"Err... a little of this, little of that. And I was wrong with our Patient, he's depressed.",5,17
He told you that when you woke him up?,Nope. Told me he pissed his pants and he blacked out.,9,11
"That's not diagnostic of depression. Lack of appetite, isolating yourself--",Uncontrollable urination and blacking out are good predictors of what?,10,10
So what? Depression and seizures aren't correlated.,"No, but you know what is? Depression and anti-depression medicine.",7,10
Antidepressants have been known to cause seizures in kids but not orgasms. This is a brain in trouble.,This is a brain with too much serotonin.,18,8
"Serotonin affects mood, appetite, it doesn't cause a brain to shut down.","Antidepressants fake brains into thinking they have more serotonin than they actually do. Every 10 million or so cases, sets off a chain reaction; produces too much, enough to fry itself.",12,31
I heard him screaming all the way down the hallway!,"If I didn't wake him, I wouldn't have learned what caused the crash. We think he had a seizure.",10,19
He's the happiest kid I know.,"But you don't know, do you?",6,6
Adam talks to us about Everything.,"Yeah, I know about the pot and the cocaine.",6,9
There was nEver... cocaine! What!,You sure? Are you having him followed?,5,7
He told us when he cheated on a math test; he told us when his girlfriend cheated on him! He doesn't hide anything from us.,But if he was depressed...,25,5

I know he is. House! You can't do this!,"Oh if I had a nickel for Every time I've heard that. Relax. Are they going to sue us? If I'm right, I save his life. If I'm wrong, he's dead no matter what I do. Either way, how much have I really hurt them?",9,45
Hey! You gotta stop this!,"They're right, he's not depressed.",5,5
"Yeah sure, I'm not letting you go until you give me that syringe.",What's that on his wrist?,13,5
Why not on his wrist?,"His back, his torso, Everything's a mess, forearms are clean. Except right there.",5,13
"Hey, did you drop acid?",Why would I do that?,5,5
"To annoy me, or maybe because you're miserable, or... because you... want to self-destruct. Pick one.",How about because LSD acts on serotonin receptors in the brain which can stop a migraine in its tracks? I'm just saying that's also a possibility. How did you know about it?,16,32
Cameron is worried about you. I told her that LSD lasts up to 12 hours; if you were functional she must be wrong.,"Well, either that or I also took a whole bunch of antidepressants which short-circuited the LSD. I'm just saying that would also explain it.",23,24
"How could that surprise you? You sent them an email complaining about my math, telling them about your stunt.",I didn't know people actually read emails. The delete button is so conveniently loCated--,19,14
So what's next? You going to follow me my whole life? Torture me?,Why would I do that?,13,5
"Right. Oh thanks, for setting me up.","An eye for an eye, LSD and antidepressants. Everything in balance. Buddhists call it karma and Christians call it the golden rule, Jews call it... I don't know. Rabbi Hillel said something poignant. Universe always settles the score.",7,38
How you doing? You work over at the college? Or are you full-time over at the--,"I'm looking for a distraction. You don't need to talk to do that, do you?",16,15
And the fact that you can barely stand upright had nothing to do with it?,Infarctions hurt that's what they do.,15,6

Have you Ever considered a career as a motivational speaker? Why don't you check out some rehab?,I did the rehab thing.,17,5
One session and you didn't Even finish that session.,The guy wanted me to visualize the healing. I can do that at home.,9,14
At least let me get you an MRI.,"It's a very simple equation; more pain, more pills.",8,9

She only had one sip of champagne.,Forget it. We'll find out from the tox screen.,7,9
"All right, look, I gave her a valium. You think that's what did this?",No. How long have you had the sweats?,14,8

"Yeah, yeah, she's an old soul. This is creepy Even for you.","She's a fashion model, on the cover of magazines. They hold her up as a sexual ideal; the law says we can't touch her for three more years. How hypocritical is that?",12,32
"Did the history rEveal anything, oh I don't know, medically relevant.","History. Right, knew I was forgetting something. You should do one of those while you're writing the labs and the tox screen.",11,22
"Or bulimia, or her age. Some girls don't start till their mid to late teens.","Evidence to the contrary; the rounded hips, the perfectly sculpted bountiful breasts.",15,12
Implants. I've seen some of her photos. They've grow dramatically since last summer.,Symptomatic of turning fourteen. Two clinic hours says that those love apples were hand crafted by God.,13,17
Could we talk about her health instead of her breasts?,"Could be relevant. Come on Cameron, there's nothing to be ashamed of, Many women dEvelop breasts -- No, I'm fine.",10,20
Fine. We'll set her up on a program; they'll wean her onto the methadone.,"And in four weeks we'll know you're right. Or we'll know that Cameron's right and the pretty girl will do Milan next fall in a wheelchair. Put her in a coma, pump her full of naltrexone. Cut the four weeks to one night.",14,43
"Stop this. Alright, I! I don't consent anymore. I want to do the slow detox.","Did you Ever get a paper cut? A really nasty one, between the fingers?

"I think I'm going crazy. And my stomach, I roll out of bed and I want to puke.",I take it you're married.,18,5
How'd you know she was--,"Because I'm doing her. You've got couvades syndrome; which is just a fancy way of saying you should stop whining. Millions of women have got the same thing, they're not bugging me. You're suffering from sympathetic pregnancy. Gotta go. People dying. Whole circle of life thing.",5,46
It's all in my head?,"No, it's all in your hormones. Good news is no ones gonna lecture you if you smoke and get drunk.",5,20
"Anterograde amnesia, short term memory loss, evidence of a hypoxic brain injury; might be the result of getting cut off from the oxygen when she flat lined.

That's your proof? That she's good looking?,"He Manages her career, travels the world with her, at her side 247; he's either a very good dad or a very bad dad. You saw that tuchas, would the fact that she's your daughter really stop you?",7,38
Your theory has the advantages of being completely unprovable and completely exculpating you.,"When you guys are done talking do an MRI and an LP; when her brain checks out as normal then we'll know that daddy really, really loves her.",13,28
Why would your mind go to abuse so fast?,I had a funny uncle.,9,5
House. Your pain is affecting your decision making.,"You got a pRoblem with a call I make, question the call don't make it personal.",8,16
Are you saying pain can't affect your mood? If I'm right about the pain you're going to want to rush Everything; which is what you're doing. Don't.,Thank you. Are you doing your daughter?,27,7
I should take your head off.,"Your glands are fine. So now you're my Patient. You've got doctor-Patient confidentiality, no worries. So what did you do to her?",6,22
How could you possibly think?,Hard to imagine anyone not wanting to nail her.,5,9
That is my daughter you're talking about.,"No, that's your daughter you were talking about. 'She just instinctively knows how to walk. Designers just love that heart shaped ass, those perfect perky--'",7,25
I'm her Manager I have to promote her.,"Oh, that makes sense. So you compartmentalize. When you're dealing with the press you're her Manager. When you're helping with homework you're her dad. When you're making sweet, sweet love you're her Manager.",8,33
What are you doing? Trying to trap me into saying--,"Do you love her enough to admit that you slept with her? Psychological conditions can Manifest themselves in physical pRoblems. Sometimes these can be extreme enough to kill. There are treatments, but only if there's a diagnosis. Are you going to admit that you slept with your daughter or are you just gonna let her die?",10,56
"Doesn't apply in abuse cases, you know that. We're Mandated to report sexual abuse.",Is it okay if I save her life first or do you want to make sure daddy doesn't get visitation rights to the grave site?,14,25
So we're just gonna leave a Parkld molester in the same room as his victim?,"It's got windows. Fine, arrest him. Use Cuddy's handcuffs.",15,9
If you're too distracted to deal with this because your leg hurts.,"Yeah, I'm distracted. I'm all hung up on this fifteen year old Patient who's cataplectic, can't remember what she had for lunch and is rapidly losing control of her body.

Find a way to kick up the contribution. What did House do now?,"Look, I'm a little busy right now. Not supposed to talk during these things. Got time Thursday?",13,17
"Look, I'm a little busy right now. Not supposed to talk during these things. Got time Thursday?",You'll have to check with Cameron.,17,6

So I'm not in trouble.,"You can torture yourself all you want. What if Everything we're seeing, is just smoke signals.",5,16
Paraneoplastic syndrome is awfully rare in a fifteen year old.,"Fifteen year olds who look like that are awfully rare. It would explain the aggressive behavior, the cataplexy, the memory loss, Even the twitParkng. It's perfect.",10,26

I just didn't want you to wash your hands. I nEver actually did find a mummy, but I did learn a fair amount about the ancient Egyptians. For example, they discovered that stannous chloride is not only great for toughening ruby glass, but if it's mixed with gold, it turns bright purple. Now, either your fingers are actually worth their weight in gold, or you've been sprinkling your husband's cereal with gold sodium thiomalate. It's an arthritis remedy it's rarely used here in the US, but it's still popular in Mexico. I've gotta give you props. I've nEver heard of anyone using gold before. It's almost! poetic.",30,118
You're wrong. I love Bob.,I nEver said you didn't love him.,5,7
Maybe she was having an affair.,Or maybe she just gets her kicks slowly sucking the life out of a guy and watParkng him suffer.,6,19
He must have done something to her.,"Yeah, he had it coming.",7,5
The only thing he did wrong was marry a sociopath.,Or maybe she just got tired of being married. Didn't want to admit to family and friends that the marriage that Everyone thought was perfect wasn't.,10,26

For a midnight snack you made a pot roast. The same pot roast I made last night.,"Yeah. Actually it was after midnight. Today is your day, right?",17,11
"You want me out of here, I get it.",No it's fine if you stay.,9,6
"The place I was going to move, the guy nEver called, otherwise I'd already be there.",I said it's fine if you stay.,16,7
"Yeah, that's why you're making me miserable.",Maybe I just want to make sure you do your fair share around here.,7,14
Why did she have a clean room in her home?,"Heart transplant. The immune system's in the toilet, mommy builds her little angel a John Travolta quality bubble.",10,18
"Six months after the transplant, she doesn't need to be confined to a clean room.","Six months without putting out, Dr Cuddy doesn't NEED to wear thong panties, but it's not our call.",15,18
"I was wondering when you'd get around to my panties. She's had 4 days of work-ups. They've tested Everyone who came anywhere near that room, Everything in the room.",It's like an Agatha Christie mystery.,29,6
Maybe it's not what was there; it's what she was doing.,Exercise allergy. Love it. What sort of exercise could a strapping young Man and a nubile teenage nymphet possibly be--,11,20
Or the girl snuck out and she's lying about that.,Or the parents are lying about the room being clean.,10,10
These are your big ideas? Somebody's lying?,"Hasn't let me down yet. Re-check mom, dad, the girl, the boy, the room and the home.",7,17

What do you think there was still some on my lips? I brushed my teeth!,"Think lower, and more fun.",15,5
I mean... it can... it can go through your stuff?,"Totally, dude! There's this administrator here, whenEver she gets sick she just gives me the prescription.",10,16
"But you know they tested Melinda, they said she wasn't allergic to my stuff.","Yeah, 4 days later. By that time the penicillin was crusting up a sock in the bottom of your hamper.",14,20
Do you have to tell her it was my fault?,"No. Great part of being a grown-up, you nEver have to do anything.",10,13

"I don't know, it just sounded like you.","New puzzle piece, always good news. What's the bad news?",8,10
What if her anaphylaxis wasn't anaphylaxis. Toxicity from the anti-rejection meds could cause a seizure and then heart failure.,And get cured by a mommy-wielded epi pen? It's anaphylaxis. What else?,19,12
"Heart failure could be either infection, coronary disease, or rejection.","Sorry, there's a reason they call it the WHITEboard. It's not my rule. What ties both of these conditions together?",10,20
You said you'd hang the stethoscope if you were having sex.,I didn't say it had to be with another person. Can you think of anything that would tie together anaphylaxis and heart failure?,11,23
"No. I was waiting out there, for hours!","Now I need a lot of foreplay, and then there's the cuddling afterwards. Any way that anaphylaxis isn't anaphylaxis Even if it responds to epi?",8,25

You STILL haven't done the dishes?!,"You want one of these? I think I got a couple of blueberries... ohh... nope, sorry just one. Well don't look all weepy. If you've got a pRoblem with me, deal with it! Short my sheets or something.",6,38
At this rate it'll be up to her lungs in a matter of days.,"So... anaphylaxis, heart failure and paralysis. We couldn't put the first two together; I'm guessing we can't put all three together.",14,21
Particularly because tick paralysis is usually accompanied by a tick. We did two comprehensive physicals looking for insect bites.,Can we put any two of those together?,19,8
"Could be a virus. West Nile, Even Polio with her immune system shot.","Get an LP. And do PCRs for the viruses. And get an EMG to check for Guillain-Barre. Foreman's right, we've got to find out why she's paralysed. But not before staring at me dumbly for a few seconds.",13,38

"You're William Tell, you could pick an apple off someone's head?","No, it's because there was no clear plastic wrap over the toilet. The stuff's in the kitchen, you have plenty of time. All that was missing was the WILL.",11,29
"Oh, so this is therapy?",No... just makes me smile.,5,5
Well I figure you wanna shave my eyebrows while I'm asleep I wouldn't want to deprive you of that last smile.,"You're not going anywhere. You're going to sit on my couch, and depress us both because you just can't admit that it's over with your wife.",21,26

Cuddy wants to get her an MRI to rule out a spinal lesion.,Cuddy? What's she doing on this?,13,6
The family lost confidence in us.,I don't blame them. I'll be right in.,6,8
This time of the year they're not spraying.,"This girl's tough. She gets what she wants. She's deprived of huMan contact; she gets herself a back door Man. Or in her case, a side window boy. What else has she been deprived of?",8,35
She's on a special diet because of her allergies.,"The boyfriend brings the hot beef, he also brings a side dish. Botulism.",9,13
"This paralysis is ascending, remember?",Not if the heart pRoblem was really a paralytic pRoblem.,5,10
We're checking for spinal lesions from leukaemia.,"Yeah, I know. Fits perfectly. Unless this is the Patient with the anaphylaxis, the heart failure, and the paralysis. In which case you're wasting your time.",7,26
We wanted a second opinion.,"Second? We've given you at least 8. Ok, well then here is 9. Botulism. Listen to me, have you eaten anything abnormal? Any canned foods?",5,25
Don't talk to her like that!,"You're right, she nEver lies. I was being rude. When your boyfriend snuck in on Friday night - surprise! - perhaps he got you some sexy little treats, huh? Some Honey or some edible underwears, massage oils, come on, anything.",6,40
"No! It was clindAmycin, what I use.",He said he was on penicillin.,7,6
What did we discuss? What was the differential?,"Cameron said... When Dan came to your House that night, did he go through any tall grass?",8,17
Tick bites don't ordinarily cause anaphylactic shock.,This girl's allergies are not ordinary.,7,6
"House, get out of here, we have to re-intubate her, and get her into the MRI.","Time course is perfect. Bite itself sets off an allergic reaction, venom takes 4 days to kick in, heart's vulnerable, hits that first. Then a day later, sets off the ascending paralysis.",16,32
Except that ticks aren't usually invisible.,"They are until you find them! oh no, that's dandruff. Okay well that wasn't nearly as dramatic as I'd hoped. It just means that next time it'll be Even better.",6,30
"She's going to need a trans-venous pacing wire. Ok, magical tick hunt is over! Only real doctor stuff now.","She's just going to get worse. Ticks produce more toxins the longer they feed.

Not inamrinone could cause death. Death's worse. We have to get her up to the ICU.,"Sorry, a little crowded in here.",16,6

Turn the elevator back on.,"Just be a minute, Honey.",5,5

I called a divorce Lawyer today.,Does that mean you're leaving?,6,5
My stack's bigger than your stack. You in or out?,"You know that relative to their size, gorillas have smaller testicles than huMans.",10,13

For all our rationality, our supposed trust and fealty to a higher power, our ability to create a system of rules and laws; our baser drives are more powerful than any of that.

I raise.",16,82
So are you going to tell me an annoying story Everytime I raise?,God that would be annoying.,13,5
"Oh! Stone cold bluff! You might want to spend a little more time paying attention to your cards, and a little less time staring at my breasts.",They don't match either. I'm going to take some air.,27,10
They don't match either. I'm going to take some air.,Follow my finger with your eyes.,10,6
How much longer will doctor Cuddy be?,"Given the number of mojitos she's knocking back at the party, I'd say it's going to be at least 3 hours before she's Even conscious.",7,25

"Well you could have just said that, you didn't have to screw with me.","Yeah if I didn't screw with you, you'd spend the whole night thinking you might get laid, which means you'd be useless. Better to extinguish all hope. Get Foreman and Cameron and meet me upstairs, stat.",14,36

Two Patients with two symptoms in common. And 5 symptoms not in common.,"While you were all wearing your 'Frankie says Relax' T-shirts, I was treating a 73-yr-old Woman who went through this progression of symptoms, the last of which was...

And less than a day to make it all the way to the rear exit.",13,75

"This kid is not Esther. You screwed up, she died, I'm sorry but that does not mean this kid is dying as well.",Geez. You get testy when you don't get any fuzz. Come on.,23,12
Ian's kidneys are shutting down.,Still think it's not the same case?,5,7
Still think it's not the same case?,"So, what can cause bloody diarrhea, ataxia and kidney failure?",7,10
I'll go and do a biopsy.,Forget it. That battle's over. His rising creatinine is his kidney's way of saying go on without me. What explains Everything?,6,21
"E. coli H0157 causes bloody diarrhea, and leads to hemolytic uremic syndrome. Toxins from the bacteria causes his kidneys to shut down, we should start him on plasmapheresis.","Clear, concise, and completely plausible. And exactly what I did last time, didn't work. What else?",28,16
Goodpasture's syndrome. Circulating antibodies cause kidney failure and bleeding.,But not the purple papules.,9,5
You check Esther for that?,"She nEver showed any signs of... if he has lymphoma this far advanced, we should be able to see it in his blood and brain. Chase, run a blood smear and immuno-chemistries. Foreman get an MRI.",5,36
She thinks the kid has a stomach ache.,"She'll come right up here and do one of two things - if she agrees with me, I don't need her, if she disagrees I don't want her.",8,28

Are you talking about me?,And what have you got?,5,5
Hmm... does sound like high dose cardio meds.,Two hearts. You got the flush?,8,6
"No, hydration is not a pRoblem.",Means she's bluffing. Push her all in.,6,7
Explains the low blood pressure.,Pretty much confirms the lymphoma. Should have started Esther on prednisone.,5,11
The fact that the end of the line is death... is an advantage?,The fact that we know is an advantage. Which means we can get ahead of it. Next station is the liver. We've got about 90 minutes before it gets there. Maybe we can cut down a tree across the line just outside of town.,13,44
How can we start treatment if we have no idea what we're treating for?,Treat him for Everything! Give him acetylcysteine and interferon and silymarine and whatEver else you can think of to protect the liver.,14,22

Why? It means he's getting sicker.,It's new. New is good. Because old ended in death.,6,10
We had to put him on a ventilator.,"He's back on Esther's path. We Managed to make the train skip a few stations which means that instead of 12 hours, he's pRobably got less than two. Which begs the question why. What did we do?",8,37
Acetylcysteine could mess with the lungs.,"Mess with them, not shut them down in 20 minutes.",6,10
Slows down all five hundred of them?,Anybody know where we can find an oncologist at this hour?,7,11
Anybody know where we can find an oncologist at this hour?,What effects would interferon have on leukemia?,11,7

You obviously want to bust me . Why would you--,Either you go all in or I tell Everybody in the building that you wear toenail polish.,10,17
I just killed two birds with one straight. Goodbye.,"Fine, keep playing, but I need you to recommend a good Oncologist because if I don't get one up here in the next few minutes, I got a dead 6-yr-old.",9,30

"Who may or may not have had Kawasaki's. This kid on the other hand, he makes antibodies that are eating the inside of his arteries, choking off blood to his major organs one by one. First the GI tract, then the kidneys, then the brain, now the lungs.",Can anyone think of a reason why Kawasaki's can't affect the elderly? Other than it doesn't. Nice.,48,17
You can't use another Patient's labs to diagnose Kawasaki's disease!,Is that like a dare or something?,10,7
You don't have time to be wrong.,"Fine. We'll look for Kawasaki where he lives, Ian's coronary arteries.",7,11
You do realise it's a metaphor?,"You do realise that the point of metaphors is to scare people from doing things by telling them that something much scarier is going to happen than what will really happen? God I wish I had a metaphor to explain that better. Go back to the game. Don't worry, I'm not going to get eaten by witches.",6,57
Esther didn't have a mass in her heart.,Ian's younger. He can take more of a pounding. Esther died before the disease reached her heart. The disease made a mass and made it fast.,8,26
You're in the atrium. Pull back. You've hit the wall of the heart.,These procedures would be so much simpler if you could do them on healthy people. And out again. V fib!,13,20

"If it's genetic he's had it all his life, why now?","I don't know, it sure fits nice enough.",11,8
"I got called away. By the angry parents of a Patient. There are THREE of you here, none of you had the sense to stop him, to pick up a phone and call me.","I told them you'd signed off.

"Well if he's brain-damaged, they might still be a little ticked.",I had to do it to save him.,11,8
"No, but you're done with him, it's my case now. Go home, go ride your motorcycle, go brood in a dark room, just don't go near Ian again.","So, anything else or is it just these sEven?",28,9
"Drop it House, she's right.",No she's not. You know she's not.,5,7
You're going to have to find a way to let this go. We can't go near Ian.,"We don't need to go near him, we have his tumor. Cuddy may be right that we screwed up the protocol, she may be right about my screwed up obsession, but I'm right about the medicine. How Many tests can we do with that?

Three would be pushing it.,"Three tests, sEven choices. Okay, what's first?",5,7
"Or it's his immune system, histiocytosis.","Well there are more documented cases of histio amongst older people than tuberous sclerosis, let's start with that.",6,18
"If we have enough tissue for two tests, why not do both?",Then we don't have to think as hard. Taking the pressure off the choice makes us less likely to think critically.,12,21
You think sarcoma's less likely?,"It's more likely, the test for it on the other hand, is less reliable.",5,14
KR67's negative. And PCH antigen is negative.,Mighty Casey is down to his last strike.,7,8
The aces were hiding all along.,Test him for Erdheim-Chester disease.,6,5
"Yeah, the tumor's got it in for you. Diseases don't lie.","Fine, it didn't lie, it slow played us. We biopsied the colon, it hadn't reached the GI tract yet. It's there now. It's in his liver, his lungs--",11,28

Move him into his own cage.,Who'll clean the droppings from mine?,6,6
Twenty-five year old female with sleep issues.,I'm guessing she's... what's the medical term? Upset. These 25-year-old females are usually completely rational. They're rocks. Really. Eh... my theory seems to be supported by the fact that she swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. Get her a shrink. And I need some shut-eye.,7,45
She's a little bit more than upset. She hasn't slept in ten days.,"She's lying. Without REM sleep, your neurons stop regenerating - the brains shut down lobe by lobe. She'd be insane after five days - dead by ten.",13,27

Wouldn't keep her awake for ten days.,"What if the poison ivy wasn't poison ivy. She got the rash that was diagnosed as poison ivy around the same time the insomnia started. Rash plus nosebleed, plus sleep disturbance equals Wegener's Granulomatosis. Start corticosteroid treatment.",7,37
The poison ivy treatment was steroids.,"Much lower dosage. Get her back on the juice, triple the dose. Get a cianga, and an upper airway biopsy to confirm the wegener's.",6,24
She heard that birth control pills can make her feel better.,She wants birth control pills for her PMS.,11,8
Is this just one of your experiments? You just wanted to see how I'd react to being screwed over by Foreman?,"Nice idea, but no. This was just good old-fashioned laziness. I gotta hand it to Foreman though, he knew that you were a suck up and I don't give a crap. He successfully exploited us both.",21,36

You know, between your incredibly witty remarks about anal sex and Cuddy's breasts, you could have tipped me off.","Then I'd have Foreman pissed at me. And as annoying as you can be, at least I know you're not going to pop a cap in my ass. Witty, huh?",31,30
But Chase says her eyes are moving the exact way.,Did you start her on the steroids?,10,7
She could have been exposed to an open wound.,Did she have a dog?,9,5
About a month ago. Her girlfriend gave it to her for her birthday.,Well then it's not allergies. She's just leaving her girlfriend.,13,10
You... spoke to the dog?,"If her birthday was a month ago, she would still be on steroids for the poison ivy. And those meds would have suppressed any reaction she might have had to the dog, which means she lied about being allergic. The dog's a commitment. You pretend to be allergic, because you don't want to tell your girlfriend that you're not planning on being around that long. So I think we can move onto options other than allergies.",5,76
Why not? Considering her current mental state.,What about her mental state?,7,5
You... were right about her wanting to break up.,"It just means I was right, doesn't mean she's suicidal.",9,10
A bottle of pills is what landed her here in the first place.,"Sleeping pills. God knows why she'd want them. What else can cause sleep disorder, and internal bleeding?",13,17
"Drugs or alcohol can mess with the sleeping, and compromise the liver.",What are you doing here? Who's keeping her awake?,12,9

"Does seem tacky, doesn't it.",I'm Doctor House. I'm in charge of your case.,5,9
What's going on? How come no one is keeping her awake any more?,You're in acute liver failure. We can continue the transfusions and the lactulose. But it's only a stopgap. There's really nothing we can do to stop the toxins from building up in your bloodstream. Which means that in a few hours you will lapse into a coma. And you won't wake up. I'm sorry.,13,54
That's it? You're giving up? You're... not going to try to figure out what's doing this to her?,"Well Even with the right diagnosis, any treatment is going to take longer than the time she has left.",18,19

"What about splenic cancer, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma? She's the right age.",It could explain the bleeding. Maybe the liver failure.,11,9
No Kayser-Fleischer rings in her eyes.,The rings don't have to be there if there's neurological symptoms.,6,11
"She's doing this out of love, and Max doesn't know---","It's only moral to save a person if they love you? That's kind of a selfish way of looking at life. I like Wilson's disease, like cancer, love mushrooms.",10,29
"Yeah, but we don't have the time to test for any of these. Before she can get the transplant, we need to do about 80 procedures.","So do those tests, and my tests at the same time. Use the PET to look for cancer, and Wilson's while you endoscope her bile ducts and scrape her stomach for mushroom spores.

"If she wants to be an idiot, it's her call. You don't need me. Have one of your team walk her through the process.","The donor and the donee sort of have opposing interests, right? Can't really advise them both.",24,16
But you know something. And it is relevant.,"If I can't tell her, I can't really tell you, can I? And if you're advising her.",8,17
I take it you've seen that?,"Seen it, digested it, watched it blow up my entire department.",6,11
Maybe. He was more analytical about the diagnostic procedures. She concentrated more on the ethical dilemmas of informed consent. How any Patient can really be informed without a medical degree.,The same old party lines.,30,5
"If you allow this sort of thing in your department, you're basically saying it's OK.","No, I'm saying that I don't care what they do as long as my life isn't interrupted by pointless conversations like this one.",15,23
Deception like this is just one step removed from actively sabotaging one another. Then what would you do?,"I could be the kindest gentlest boss in the world, and Foreman still would have done what he did because that's who he is. We can only hope that Cameron has learned something.",18,33

Max's cardiac arrest was caused by hypoxia from hypoventilation. They restarted her heart and the right lobe of her liver was successfully transplanted into Hannah.,"Now, where were we before we were so rudely interrupted by the liver transplant?",25,14
"Gastric content was negative for spores, so no mushroom toxicity.",And the initial tests were negative for cancer.,10,8

The steroids and the immuno-suppressants acted like a big hunk of dam across the river. Physics 101, put a dam up in front of a raging river, the river rises.

What are you looking for?,I called my mom. She didn't pick up. What did the angio tell us?,5,14
That Foreman should be off this case.,He's a neurologist. Unless you think the Patient's optic nerve is in his spleen.,7,14
I was just busting the guy's chops.,"See! He was just busting the guy's chops. Foreman is essential to solving this case. Medically, what did the angio tell us?",7,22
"There appears to be some clotting, possibly around the Circle of Willis. Based on the progression of symptoms, the clot is growing. We need to cut into-","Saying there appears to be clotting is like saying there's a traffic jam up ahead. Is it a ten-car pileup? Or just a really slow bus in the center lane, and if it is a bus is it a thrombotic bus, or an embolic bus? Think I pushed that metaphor too far.",27,52
Angio can't tell us that kind of information.,"Oh, so you're saying it was just a waste of time?",8,11
It gave us some information without killing him.,You don't know that an MRI will kill him!,8,9
The bullets have a ferrous base!,Little tiny pieces trapped in his head. They're not going anywhere!,6,11
Maybe it's worth attempting surgery to remove the fragments.,"Surgeons say inoperable, and the Patient's on blood thinners. Other than that, perfect plan.",9,14
You got a better plan?,Much! Bullet's identical to the one Baby Shoes popped Joe with. Let's see how magnetic it is.,5,17
"The bullet split into four fragments, no exit wounds.",Only used a half-load of gunpowder.,9,6
I'm not sure. I didn't have my thesaurus with me.,"One implies he took pleasure in it. I want to know if it was repressed black anger, or just giddiness.",10,20
Whoa! Whoa! You think I'm sick?,I think that an appropriate response to watParkng your boss shoot a corpse is not to grin foolishly.,6,18
The fact that I've grown bored by your insanity is proof of nothing.,"Dr. Foreman, Dr. Chase requests your assistance!",13,7
I can't Even imagine the backwards logic you used to rationalize shooting a corpse.,"Well if I'd shot a live person, there's a lot more paperwork.",14,12
Then it won't be a pRoblem for you to stand beside the casket at the wake and explain why a cancer Patient has a bullet hole in his head.,"The Man donated his body to science! Yes, it's a tragedy! If I hadn't shot him, his body could have spent the next year letting first year med students use the carpool lane.",29,33
"Do not turn that on, House!","You're mad because I put a bullet in his head. At the worst, all I'm doing now is taking it out.",6,21
"They have to, uh, shut down the magnet to fix it. MRI's gonna be out of commission for at least two weeks.",Well it doesn't matter; we obviously can't use it on this Patient.,22,12
"No, but there are other doctors in this hospital, and other Patients.",That helps explain how they can afford all the fancy equipment. I'm sure not pulling my weight.,12,17
Looking for what? The pRoblem is obviously neurological.,Clots are in his brain. The source of the clots may not be. Do a complete transthoracic echocardiogram. Maybe we get lucky. Maybe the clots are coming from his heart.,8,30
"If I'm not sick, all you're doing is locking me up with the source. I'll get sick prove you right.","If you're not sick, it's not contagious and you've got nothing to worry about. If you are sick, the two of you are staying in here until we find out why. So you might want to make friends with the pig. Good news is I can finally get my MRI.",20,50
No you can't! You blew up the maParkne!,"Not the portable one, Chuckles. Chase and Cameron are bringing it to scan your non-bullet riddled head.",8,17
So I'm just a regular Patient now?,No! You get your own thermometer!,7,6
No! You get your own thermometer!,"Check your blood, anyone with an elevated SED rate gets to be Foreman's new roomie.",6,15
He's got the most motivation to get this diagnosed.,"Right. You're not Even friends with him, why would you care? There's an area of increased T-2 attenuation is the cingulate cortex.",9,22
"Question you might want to ask! a neurologist. Foreman is a selfish jerk, but he's a neurologist, and he's the only one who's been in that apartment.","This is why he shouldn't be here. You wouldn't call him a jerk if he was here. If you think he screwed up at that apartment, you'd keep it to yourself.",27,31
"West Nile, or Eastern Equine Encephalitis!","Test Foreman's blood. Given that he's the only one that got it, person to person transmission is less likely then some sort of deadly toxin that Foreman picked up at the guy's home. Who wants to go next?",6,38
"Test Foreman's blood. Given that he's the only one that got it, person to person transmission is less likely then some sort of deadly toxin that Foreman picked up at the guy's home. Who wants to go next?",Whoa! You're ready to sacrifice yourself for a guy that doesn't consider you a friend?,38,15
He's just a Patient right? It's the job.,Hey! You don't have to go anywhere. Joe's apartment is right downstairs in the lab. Foreman brought back samples of Everything.,8,21
"What was that, 'Who wants to go next'? Some kind of test?","Don't worry. You made the right call. Foreman stumbled into whatEver it is without knowing, and he's way smarter than you are.",12,22
"We have to go back to Joe's apartment, get more samples",No one goes back to that place 'til we know what we are looking for. Get some of that cop tape stick it over the doors and the windows.,11,29
I'll take all the HAZMAT precautions. The chance of infection is next to nothing.,"Yeah, I was nEver that great a math, but next to nothing is! higher than nothing, right?",14,17
It would be his fault if we did.,We should get a sample directly from Joe's brain,8,9
We can't do a biopsy. There's too much edema from the bleeding because you gave him heparin.,Well I don't think that this is the time to be pointing fingers. I didn't give Foreman any.,17,18
You wanna give Foreman a brain biopsy?,"Come on, really, who doesn't?",7,5
This could be a simple staph infection causing neurodegeneration.,"Without a fEver, not a chance.",9,6
"The mush might be forming an abscess. And since there was inflammation in the lining of the ventricles, it makes sense. The staph releases toxins, causes neurodegeneration, causes a lesion.",This is a waste of time.,30,6
We should put an Ommaya reservoir in Foreman's brain to start administrating antibi-,"If I'm gonna be arguing with Foreman, I may as well do it directly.",13,14
"Kernig's sign negative. Brudzinski's sign, single positive. Patient Joe Lureia distal and proximal arm contractures. Duration four seconds.",Staph infection most commonly presents on the skin.,18,8
No. Think that's a!.good thing?,"Sort of doubt it. Staph would be in your heart, lungs, spleen, liver or kidneys before it gets to your brain. Your organs are clear. It's not staph.",5,28
The infection could be limited to a brain abscess.,Which I would've seen in your MRI Sign this so that I can take out a piece of your brain.,9,20
Let me see the MRI.,There was no abscess on the image.,5,7
Let me see it then.,I liked you better when you were jolly.,5,8
MRI was taken over an hour ago. That soft spot can now be an abscess.,"If it was staph you would have a fEver, which you don't!",15,12
Square again. Why is he here?,Because my neurologist is having surgery!,6,6
I thought I was just another Patient.,You didn't beliEve that crap did you? Date of birth.,7,10
"The Ommaya reservoir is inserted into the parietal lobe. My spatial recognition is the issue, not my memory.","Oops! Did you say Ommaya? I could have sworn you said biopsy. Hey, I'm just messing with your head. Mother's maiden name, please.",18,23
His result for staph: Negative. He's not Even a carrier.,"Well, at least Foreman was wrong, too.",10,7
Can I go to Joe's apartment now?,No. Go back to the lab. Start retesting all the samples that Foreman collected.,7,14
"Then Hurry! Cameron, suit up. You're gonna monitor Foreman. He's on to hand contractures; he'll be on Anton's blindness soon. Run hourly checks because when he does go blind he won't be able to tell us. We'll use the data to construct a timeline so we'll see how far behind Joe he is.",Why are you still here?,53,5
You're being cautious. You're being!common. When you don't give a crap-,How Many of your guys have caught cancer from their Patients? Let me know when that happens. Then we can have this conversation.,11,23
"It's just another case, huh?","I'll bet you can Even have unprotected sex with your cancer Patients without Even catParkng a damn thing. Boy, I wish I had your job.",5,25
Mainline morphine into his carotid could stop his heart!,So could pain-induced stress cardiomyopathy. Either the morphine kills him or the pain does.,9,14
I'm gonna make you feel better.,Joe has a new symptom: hyperalgesia.,6,6
Joe has a new symptom: hyperalgesia.,The infection is spreading into the pain center of the brain.,6,11
"His brain is telling him that his whole body is in pain. Because of the location, the painkillers do nothing.",Suit up. Put the guy in a coma before the pain kills him.,20,13
What if he used cedar wood to hide the pot smell? Aureobasidium fungus can grow there.,Did you find any cedar wood anywhere?,16,7
Maybe what? Maybe somebody can go back and take a second look? And why aren't you pissed off that Cameron's playing hooky while your life hangs in the balance?,Why doesn't anyone listen to me anymore?,29,7
I decided you were wrong.,"God, you're weak. Guy steals your article, tells you you're not his friend. You still wanna risk your life for him.",5,21
I'm not here for Foreman; I'm here to save myself.,"Ehh!. Even with a needle stick, your chances of infection are pretty slim. That's why you're wearing the suit. You wanted to be here. He just gave you the excuse. What does that guy have to do to make you hate him?",10,42

We'll have the results in! three days.,"Ah, that's a shame, because Foreman will nEver get a chance to know what it was, because he'll be dead in 36 hours. Maybe this is a toxin; maybe it's not contagious at all. You're killing Foreman because of a ""maybe.""",7,41
